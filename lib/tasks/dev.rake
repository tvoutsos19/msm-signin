His directorial fame escalated with the release of The Godfather in 1972. The film revolutionized movie-making in the gangster genre, garnering universal laurels from critics and public alike. It went on to win three Academy Awards, including his second, which he won for Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was instrumental in cementing his position as one of the prominent American film directors. Coppola followed it with an equally successful sequel The Godfather Part II, which became the first ever sequel to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. The film received yet higher praises than its predecessor, and gave him three Academy Awards—for Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Director and Best Picture. In the same year was released The Conversation, which he directed, produced and wrote. The film went on to win the Palme d'Or at the 1974 Cannes Film Festival. His next directorial venture was Apocalypse Now in 1979, and it was as notorious for its lengthy and troubled production as it was critically acclaimed for its vivid and stark depiction of the Vietnam War.

He was noted by Turner Classic Movies for his \"strong direction of actors\", \"vigorous storytelling\" and the \"social realism\" in his best work. Film critic Roger Ebert described him as having been \"one of the finest craftsmen and warmest humanitarians among all film directors.\" Lumet was also known as an \"actor's director,\" having worked with the best of them during his career, probably more than \"any other director.\"\n\nLumet began his career as an Off-Broadway director, then became a highly efficient TV director. His first movie was typical of his best work: a well-acted, tightly written, deeply considered \"problem picture,\" 12 Angry Men (1957). From that point on Lumet divided his energies among other idealistic problem pictures along with literate adaptations of plays and novels, big stylish pictures, New York-based black comedies, and realistic crime dramas, including Serpico and Prince of the City. As a result of directing 12 Angry Men, he was also responsible for leading the first wave of directors who made a successful transition from TV to movies. In 2005, Lumet received an Academy Award for Lifetime Achievement for his \"brilliant services to screenwriters, performers, and the art of the motion picture.\" Two years later, he concluded his career with the acclaimed drama Before the Devil Knows You're Dead (2007).\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Sidney Lumet, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.​", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/gqG48st9nYSZiUT8Q9Qq2ni9iER.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>488, :name=>"Steven Spielberg", :dob=>"1946-12-18", :bio=>"Steven Allan Spielberg KBE (born December 18, 1946) is an American film director, producer, and screenwriter.

Regarded as one of the most important and influential filmmakers in the history of cinema, Kurosawa directed 30 films in a career spanning 57 years. Kurosawa entered the Japanese film industry in 1936, following a brief stint as a painter. After years of working on numerous films as an assistant director and scriptwriter, he made his debut as a director in 1943, during World War II with the popular action film Sanshiro Sugata (a.k.a. Judo Saga). After the war, the critically acclaimed Drunken Angel (1948), in which Kurosawa cast then-unknown actor Toshirō Mifune in a starring role, cemented the director's reputation as one of the most important young filmmakers in Japan. The two men would go on to collaborate on another 15 films. Rashomon, which premiered in Tokyo in August 1950, and which also starred Mifune, became, on September 10, 1951, the surprise winner of the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival and was subsequently released in Europe and North America. The commercial and critical success of this film opened up Western film markets for the first time to the products of the Japanese film industry, which in turn led to international recognition for other Japanese film artists. Throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, Kurosawa directed approximately a film a year, including a number of highly regarded films such as Ikiru (1952), Seven Samurai (1954) and Yojimbo (1961). After the mid-1960s, he became much less prolific, but his later work—including his final two epics, Kagemusha (1980) and Ran (1985)—continued to win awards, including the Palme d'Or for Kagemusha, though more often abroad than in Japan.

He continued to work in various roles in the animation industry over the decade until he was able to direct his first feature film Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro which was published in 1979. After the success of his next film, Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, he co-founded Studio Ghibli where he continued to produce many feature films until Princess Mononoke whereafter he temporarily retired.\n\nWhile Miyazaki's films have long enjoyed both commercial and critical success in Japan, he remained largely unknown to the West until Miramax released his 1997 film, Princess Mononoke. Princess Mononoke was the highest-grossing film in Japan—until it was eclipsed by another 1997 film, Titanic—and the first animated film to win Picture of the Year at the Japanese Academy Awards. Miyazaki returned to animation with Spirited Away. The film topped Titanic's sales at the Japanese box office, also won Picture of the Year at the Japanese Academy Awards and was the first anime film to win an American Academy Award.\n\nMiyazaki's films often incorporate recurrent themes, such as humanity's relationship to nature and technology, and the difficulty of maintaining a pacifist ethic. Reflecting Miyazaki's feminism, the protagonists of his films are often strong, independent girls or young women. Miyazaki is a vocal critic of capitalism and globalization.[3] While two of his films, The Castle of Cagliostro and Castle in the Sky, involve traditional villains, his other films such as Nausicaa or Princess Mononoke present morally ambiguous antagonists with redeeming qualities.", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/1OBQPIwR88n49oAEzk47k0fhhOV.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>21684, :name=>"Bong Joon-ho", :dob=>"1969-09-14", :bio=>"Bong Joon-ho (Korean: 봉준호; born September 14, 1969) is a South Korean filmmaker of international prominence.

Born in Paris to Polish parents, Polanski relocated with his family to Poland in 1937. After surviving the Holocaust, he continued his education in Poland and became a critically acclaimed director of both art house and commercial films. Polanski's first feature-length film, Knife in the Water (1962), made in Poland, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. He has since received five more Oscar nominations, and in 2002 received the Academy Award for Best Director for his film, The Pianist. He has also been the recipient of two Baftas, four Césars, a Golden Globe and the Palme d'Or. He left Poland in 1961 to live in France for several years, then moved to the United Kingdom where he collaborated with Gérard Brach on three films, beginning with Repulsion (1965). In 1968 he moved to the United States, immediately cementing his burgeoning directing status with the 1968 groundbreaking Academy Award winning horror film Rosemary's Baby.\n\nIn 1969, Polanski's pregnant wife, Sharon Tate, was murdered while staying at the Polanski's Benedict Canyon home above Los Angeles by members of the Manson Family. Following Tate's death, Polanski returned to Europe and spent much of his time in Paris and Gstaad, but did not make another film until he filmed Macbeth (1971) in England. The following year he went to Italy to make What? (1973) and subsequently spent the next five years living near Rome. However, he traveled to Hollywood to direct Chinatown (1974) for Paramount Pictures, with Robert Evans serving as producer. The film was nominated for eleven Academy Awards, and was a critical and box-office success; the script by Robert Towne won for Best Original Screenplay. Polanski's next film, The Tenant (1976), was shot in France, and completed the \"Apartment Trilogy\", following Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby.\n\nIn 1977, after a photo shoot in Los Angeles, Polanski was arrested for the sexual abuse of a 13 year old girl. He was charged with rape but pleaded guilty to unlawful sex with a minor. To avoid sentencing, Polanski fled to his home in London, and then moved on to France the following day. He has had a U.S. arrest warrant outstanding since then, and an international arrest warrant since 2005.\n\nPolanski continued to make films such as The Pianist (2002), a World War II-set adaptation of Jewish-Polish musician Władysław Szpilman's autobiography of the same name, which echoed some of Polanski's earlier life experiences. Like Szpilman, Polanski escaped the ghetto and the concentration camps while family members were killed. The film won three Academy Awards including Best Director, the Cannes Film Festival's Palme d'Or, and seven French César Awards including Best Picture and Best Director. He then released the successful films Oliver Twist (2005), To Each His Own Cinema (2007), and The Ghost Writer (2010), completed while under house arrest.\n\nIn September 2009, Polanski was arrested by Swiss police, at the request of U.S. authorities, when he traveled to receive a lifetime achievement award at the Zurich Film Festival. In October 2009, the U.S. requested his extradition; however, on July 12, 2010, the Swiss rejected that request and instead declared him a \"free man\" after releasing him from custody.", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/yHwHSXdZatkoLgIjPeW14GKlrZs.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>2710, :name=>"James Cameron", :dob=>"1954-08-16", :bio=>"James Cameron was born in Kapuskasing, Ontario, Canada, on August 16, 1954.

He pioneered many techniques in the suspense and psychological thriller genres. After a successful career in his native United Kingdom in both silent films and early talkies, Hitchcock moved to Hollywood. In 1956 he became an American citizen while remaining a British subject. Over a career spanning more than half a century, Hitchcock fashioned for himself a distinctive and recognizable directorial style. He pioneered the use of a camera made to move in a way that mimics a person's gaze, forcing viewers to engage in a form of voyeurism. He framed shots to maximize anxiety, fear, or empathy, and used innovative film editing. His stories frequently feature fugitives on the run from the law alongside “icy blonde” female characters. Many of Hitchcock's films have twist endings and thrilling plots featuring depictions of violence, murder, and crime, although many of the mysteries function as decoys or MacGuffins meant only to serve thematic elements in the film and the extremely complex psychological examinations of the characters. Hitchcock's films also borrow many themes from psychoanalysis and feature strong sexual undertones. Through his cameo appearances in his own films, interviews, film trailers, and the television program Alfred Hitchcock Presents, he became a cultural icon. Hitchcock directed more than fifty feature films in a career spanning six decades. Often regarded as the greatest British filmmaker, he came first in a 2007 poll of film critics in Britain's Daily Telegraph, which said: “Unquestionably the greatest filmmaker to emerge from these islands, Hitchcock did more than any director to shape modern cinema, which would be utterly different without him. His flair was for narrative, cruelly withholding crucial information (from his characters and from us) and engaging the emotions of the audience like no one else.” The magazine MovieMaker has described him as the most influential filmmaker of all-time, and he is widely regarded as one of cinema's most significant artists.", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/108fiNM6poRieMg7RIqLJRxdAwG.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>578, :name=>"Ridley Scott", :dob=>"1937-11-30", :bio=>"Scott was born in South Shields, Tyne and Wear, England, the son of Elizabeth and Colonel Francis Percy Scott. He was raised in an Army family, meaning that for most of his early life, his father — an officer in the Royal Engineers — was absent.

During this time the family moved around, living in (among other areas) Cumbria, Wales and Germany. He has a younger brother, Tony, also a film director. After the Second World War, the Scott family moved back to their native north-east England, eventually settling in Teesside (whose industrial landscape would later inspire similar scenes in Blade Runner). He enjoyed watching films, and his favourites include Lawrence of Arabia, Citizen Kane and Seven Samurai. Scott studied in Teesside from 1954 to 1958, at Grangefield Grammar School and later in West Hartlepool College of Art, graduating with a Diploma in Design. He progressed to an M.A. in graphic design at the Royal College of Art from 1960 to 1962.\n\nAt the RCA he contributed to the college magazine, ARK and helped to establish its film department. For his final show, he made a black and white short film, Boy and Bicycle, starring his younger brother, Tony Scott, and his father. The film's main visual elements would become features of Scott's later work; it was issued on the 'Extras' section of The Duellists DVD. After graduation in 1963, he secured a job as a trainee set designer with the BBC, leading to work on the popular television police series Z-Cars and the science fiction series Out of the Unknown. Scott was an admirer of Stanley Kubrick early in his development as a director. For his entry to the BBC traineeship, Scott remade Paths of Glory as a short film.\n\nHe was assigned to design the second Doctor Who serial, The Daleks, which would have entailed realising the famous alien creatures. However, shortly before Scott was due to start work, a schedule conflict meant that he was replaced on the serial by Raymond Cusick.\n\nAt the BBC, Scott was placed into a director training programme and, before he left the corporation, had directed episodes of Z-Cars, its spin-off, Softly, Softly, and adventure series Adam Adamant Lives!\n\nIn 1968, Ridley and Tony Scott founded Ridley Scott Associates (RSA), a film and commercial production company.Five members of the Scott family are directors, all working for RSA.

Delate's first professional acting work (and his very special association with the New York Shakespeare Festival) began in 1981, when he was cast in both of the plays performed in Central Park that summer - Henry IV, Part I and The Tempest. Other plays followed (including Joseph Papp's Hamlet with Diane Venora), and in 1984-1985, Delate received critical acclaim for his performance in the award-winning play, Tracers, which had successful runs in both New York (NYSF) and London (Royal Court). An abundance of daytime television and commercial work followed. In 1987, William Friedkin cast him in Python Wolf and not long after, David Jones cast him opposite Robert DeNiro and Ed Harris in Jacknife. Theatre, film and television opportunities all combined to help Delate thrive as an actor. He spent three seasons with the River Arts Repertory, and three seasons with Phoenix Theatre Company doing rotating repertory theatre, along with numerous theatre acting stints in and out of New York. One piece of trivia from that time was that Delate got to play the Humphrey Bogart role of Rick in the only sanctioned stage production of Casablanca permitted by Warner Brothers.  Delate has had the privilege to work with some of the most talented and creative directors and actors in the industry -- most recently in The Brave One (directed by Neil Jordan, with Jodie Foster), in Salome on Broadway, directed by Estelle Parsons and elsewhere and in the film, Salomaybe (both with Al Pacino), as well as in My Brother (directed by Anthony Lover), Buffalo Soldiers (directed by Gregor Jordan, with Ed Harris and Joaquin Phoenix), The Truman Show (directed by Peter Weir, with Jim Carrey and Laura Linney), American Wake and Home Before Dark (both directed by Maureen Foley, the latter with Katherine Ross), Sudden Death (directed by Peter Hyams), Far From Heaven (directed by Todd Haynes), Ash Wednesday (directed by Edward Burns), and The Shawshank Redemption (directed by Frank Darabont, with Tim Robbins).", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/rydDYe4VHjZsJZPWOus4KGkhroG.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>79025, :name=>"Don McManus", :dob=>"1959-11-08", :bio=>"Don McManus is an actor.", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/ilHsejG5ZbqCJRonmgZGzacx5LS.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>2574896, :name=>"Donald Zinn", :dob=>nil, :bio=>"", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/pFmOMOBgOaI1idD7BuEFpGShfW8.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>1422439, :name=>"Dorothy Silver", :dob=>nil, :bio=>"", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/nZNrUhLbEGHQfot0rPcep8wzzpf.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>123302, :name=>"Robert Haley", :dob=>"1942-08-16", :bio=>"", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/cf7UhLqiRXB2efOyPHh34dqJhP4.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>74337, :name=>"Dana Snyder", :dob=>"1973-11-14", :bio=>"​From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nDana Snyder (born November 14, 1973) is an American stand-up comedian, actor, voice artist, and comedian, best known for playing Master Shake on the Aqua Teen Hunger Force show, and the film Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters, both part of Cartoon Network's Adult Swim franchise.

Spagnuolo in Manhattan, New York of Italian immigrant parents, and the last of six children. His father, Pelegrino Spagnuolo (b. 1892, d. 1950), died from liver and kidney disease. His mother Filomena Spagnuolo (b. 1903, d. 1987) was a bit-part actress who acted in a few movies, some of them alongside her son. Spinell stood 5 foot and 11 inches. He was born at his family's apartment in Manhattan's Little Italy on 2nd Avenue in Manhattan. A few years after the death of his father, he moved with his mother and older siblings to Woodside, Queens, New York where he lived off-and-on for the remainder of his life. Spinell suffered most of his life from hemophilia as well as chronic asthma. Because of his large, heavyset frame and imposing looks, Spinell was often cast as criminals, thugs, or corrupt police officers. His most notable roles were as mafioso Willi Cicci in The Godfather and The Godfather Part II, and as loan shark Tony Gazzo in Rocky and Rocky II. Although primarily known as a character actor, Spinell co-wrote and starred as a serial killer in the 1980 film, Maniac. Joe Spinell died in his apartment on January 13, 1989 at the age of 52. The cause of his untimely death is arguable to this day. Some say that his death was caused by sudden heart attack due to heavy drug use, drinking and emotional distress in light of his mother passing away two years earlier. It is also speculated that he may have died from asthma complications, or bled to death from hemophilia related causes. He was planning a sequel to Maniac before his death. He was buried in Calvary Cemetery, Queens near his home. He is the distant cousin of the American football team St. Louis Ram's Head Coach Steve Spagnuolo. Spinell was married to adult film star Jean Jennings from February 1977 to July 1979.

He is considered the \"father of method acting in America,\" according to author Mel Gussow, and from the 1920s until his death in 1982 \"he revolutionized the art of acting by having a profound influence on performance in American theater and movies\".  From his base in New York, he trained several generations of theatre and film's most illustrious talents, including Anne Bancroft, Dustin Hoffman, Montgomery Clift, Marlon Brando, James Dean, Marilyn Monroe, Julie Harris, Paul Newman, Al Pacino, Robert De Niro and director Elia Kazan.  Former student Elia Kazan directed James Dean in East of Eden (1955), for which Kazan and Dean were nominated for Academy Awards. As a student, Dean wrote that Actors Studio was \"the greatest school of the theater [and] the best thing that can happen to an actor\".  Playwright Tennessee Williams, writer of A Streetcar Named Desire, said of Strasberg's actors, \"They act from the inside out. They communicate emotions they really feel. They give you a sense of life.\" Directors like Sidney Lumet, a former student, have intentionally used actors skilled in Strasberg's \"Method\".  Kazan, in his autobiography, wrote, \"He carried with him the aura of a prophet, a magician, a witch doctor, a psychoanalyst, and a feared father of a Jewish home....

In addition to starring roles in big budget Hollywood films, he has long been heavily involved in films produced by independent producers and art houses. Bale first caught the public eye when he was cast in the starring role of Steven Spielberg's Empire of the Sun at the age of 13, playing an English boy who is separated from his parents and subsequently finds himself lost in a Japanese internment camp during World War II. Since then, he has portrayed a wide range of characters. Bale is especially noted for his cult following: the tenth anniversary issue of Entertainment Weekly hailed him as one of the \"Top 8 Most Powerful Cult Figures of the Past Decade\", citing his cult status on the Internet. EW called Bale one of the \"Most Creative People in Entertainment\" in anticipation of the release American Psycho (2000). The Guardian named Bale as one of the best actors never to have received an Academy Award nomination.  Bale is most well-known for starring as Bruce Wayne/Batman in Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight trilogy. All three films earned critical praise and did well at the box office by making over 2 billion combined dollars between the three films.  Bale was born in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, Wales to parents of English descent. His father, David Bale, was an entrepreneur, commercial pilot, and talent manager and his mother, Jenny James, was a circus clown and performer. He is the youngest of four children. After leaving Wales in 1976, Bale spent his childhood in several countries, including England, Portugal and the United States. Settling for four years in Bournemouth and Henley-on-Thames, Bale was educated at Shiplake C of E Primary School, the independent Dolphin School in Berkshire, and at Bournemouth School. He participated actively in rugby union. Bale has described his childhood, with respect to his mother being in the circus, as \"interesting\". He recalled his first kiss was with an acrobat named Barta. As a child, he trained in ballet and guitar. His sister Louise's work in theatre also influenced his decision to become an actor. Bale's father was very supportive of his son's acting, resigning from his job as a commercial pilot to travel and manage Bale's burgeoning career. Bale's first foray into acting was a commercial for the fabric softener Lenor in 1982, when he was eight years old. He appeared in a Pac-Man cereal commercial playing a child rock star a year later and in 1984 made his stage debut in The Nerd, opposite Rowan Atkinson.\n\nOn 29 January, 2000, Bale married Sandra \"Sibi\" Blažić (born 1970), a one-time model, make-up artist and personal assistant to Winona Ryder; the couple have a daughter, Emmeline, who was born on 27 March 2005, in Santa Monica, California.

He also played the role of Willy Loman in the original Broadway production of Arthur Miller's 1949 play Death of a Salesman under the direction of Elia Kazan. On television, Cobb costarred in the first four seasons of the popular, long-running western series The Virginian. He typically played arrogant, intimidating, and abrasive characters, but often had roles as respectable figures such as judges.  Born Leo Jacob in New York City, he grew up in The Bronx,  before studying at New York University and making his film debut in The Vanishing Shadow (1934).  Cobb performed in numerous theater productions and companies, including Group Theatre (New York) before serving in the First Motion Picture Unit of the Army Air Force during World War II.  \n\nFollowing the war, Cobb returned to film, television and theater before being accused of being a Communist in 1951 testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee by Larry Parks, himself a former Communist Party member. Cobb was called to testify before HUAC but refused to do so for two years until, with his career threatened by the blacklist, he relented in 1953 and gave testimony in which he named 20 people as former members of the Communist Party USA. Following the hearing he resumed his career and worked with Elia Kazan and Budd Schulberg, two other HUAC \"friendly witnesses\", on the 1954 film On the Waterfront, which is widely seen as an allegory and apologia for testifying.  His 1968 performance as King Lear achieved the longest run (72 performances) for the play in Broadway history.  One of his final film roles was that of police detective Lt.

Fonda cultivated a strong, appealing screen image in several films now considered to be classics, earning one Academy Award for Best Actor on two nominations.\n\nFonda made his mark early as a Broadway actor and made his Hollywood film debut in 1935. His film career began to gain momentum with roles such as Bette Davis's fiancee in her Academy Award-winning performance in Jezebel (1938), brother Frank in Jesse James (1939), and the future President in Young Mr. Lincoln (1939), directed by John Ford. His early career peaked with his Academy Award-nominated performance as Tom Joad in The Grapes of Wrath, about an Oklahoma family who moved to California during the Dust Bowl 1930s. This film is widely considered to be among the greatest American films.\n\nIn 1941 he starred opposite Barbara Stanwyck in the screwball comedy classic The Lady Eve. Book-ending his service in WWII were his starring roles in two highly regarded westerns: The Ox-Bow Incident (1943) and My Darling Clementine (1946), the latter directed by John Ford, and he also starred in Ford's western Fort Apache (1948). After a seven-year break from films, during which Fonda focused on stage productions, he returned with the WWII war-boat ensemble Mister Roberts (1955). In 1957 he starred as Juror No.8, the hold-out juror, in 12 Angry Men. Fonda, who was also co-producer, won the BAFTA for Best Foreign Actor.\n\nLater in his career, Fonda moved into darker roles, such as the villain in the epic Once Upon a Time in the West (1968), underrated and a box office disappointment at its time of release, but now regarded as one of the best westerns of all time. He also played in lighter-hearted fare such as Yours, Mine and Ours with Lucille Ball, but also often played important military figures, such as a Colonel in Battle of the Bulge (1965), and Admiral Nimitz in Midway (1976). He finally won the Academy Award for Best Actor at the 54th Academy Awards for his final film role in On Golden Pond (1981), which also starred Katharine Hepburn and his daughter Jane Fonda, but was too ill to attend the ceremony. He died from heart disease a few months later.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Henry Fonda, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/9DtuGZrwsEFUE9VhrkHEUusF0hZ.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>5252, :name=>"Joseph Sweeney", :dob=>"1884-07-26", :bio=>"", :image=>"https://robohash.org/Joseph Sweeney?set=set3", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>42157, :name=>"Ed Begley Jr.", :dob=>"1949-09-16", :bio=>"​From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nEdward James \"Ed\" Begley, Jr. (born September 16, 1949) is an American actor and environmentalist.

He appeared in the ensemble film New York, I Love You, and will have roles in Sympathy for Delicious and Main Street. Bloom made his professional stage debut in West End's In Celebration at the Duke of York's Theatre, St. Martin's Lane, which ended its run on 15 September 2007.\n\nOrlando Bloom was born in Canterbury, Kent, England. His mother, Sonia Constance Josephine (née Copeland), was born in the British section of Kolkata, India, the daughter of Betty Constance Josephine Walker and Francis John Copeland, who was a physician and surgeon. During his childhood, Bloom was told that his father was his mother's husband, South African-born Jewish anti-Apartheid novelist Harry Saul Bloom; but when he was thirteen (nine years after Harry's death), Bloom's mother revealed to him that his biological father was actually Colin Stone, his mother's partner and family friend. Stone, the principal of the Concorde International language school, was made Orlando Bloom's legal guardian after Harry Bloom's death. Bloom, who is named after the 16th century composer Orlando Gibbons, has one sister, Samantha Bloom, who was born in 1975.\n\nBloom's first appearance on the screen was as a rent boy in the 1997 film Wilde - he had a small part. Two days after graduating from Guildhall in 1999, he was cast in his first major role, playing Legolas in The Lord of the Rings (2001–2003). He had originally auditioned for the part of Faramir, who doesn't appear until the second movie but the director, Peter Jackson, cast him as Legolas instead.\n\nBloom met American actress Kate Bosworth outside a coffee shop in 2002, where he was introduced to her by a mutual friend. He met her again at the premiere of The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers later that year. The two had an \"on-and-off relationship\" from 2002 until splitting up in September 2006. In late 2007, Bloom began dating Australian model Miranda Kerr. The couple's engagement was announced on June 21, 2010.\n\nBloom has said that he tries \"not to exclude [himself] from real life as much as possible\". He is a Manchester United fan and lives in London. During filming in Morocco for Kingdom of Heaven, Bloom rescued and adopted a dog, Sidi (a black Saluki mix with a white mark on his chest). Bloom is a practising Buddhist. In 2004, he became a full member of Soka Gakkai International, a lay Buddhist association affiliated with the teachings of Nichiren.

Her first starring role was in John Sayles's film, Baby It's You, highly regarded by Rotten Tomatoes reviewers, but not widely distributed. She starred in Desperately Seeking Susan alongside pop singer Madonna, for which Arquette won a British Academy Film Awards (BAFTA) for her supporting role.

The Guardian wrote, \"She has no evidence that Weinstein warned others against her (though Peter Jackson has admitted to blacklisting Sorvino and Ashley Judd under pressure from Weinstein).\" When the industry scuttlebutt about Weinstein's predation broke into the news in October 2017, Arquette was one of the first actresses to speak openly about his misconduct, with Ronan Farrow for The New Yorker and The New York Times's Jodi Kantor.

As a teen, Richard acted in films such as 'The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh.'\n\nIn 1980, Richard formed a duo with his best friend from school, John Walker, and soon \"Walker and Rossi\" were performing their songs on TV. The Post Gazette compared them to Simon & Garfunkel and called them poets of song.  In 1984, Richard married his wife Sherrie in Lynchburg, Virginia. Sherrie saw Walker-Rossi perform at Liberty U., where they were given a standing ovation by the audience of 5,000. Richard & Sherrie moved back to Pgh. in 1986. Richard reached out to his hometown, performing concerts as a guitar-playing maverick minister at the nightclub Graffiti, Station Square, and Soldier's & Sailors.\n\nIn 1988, Richard and Sherrie became parents.

These roles, along with several others in which he plays tough-talking no-nonsense police officers, have made him an enduring cultural icon of masculinity.\n\nEastwood won Academy Awards for Best Director and Producer of the Best Picture, as well as receiving nominations for Best Actor, for his work in the films Unforgiven (1992) and Million Dollar Baby (2004). These films in particular, as well as others including Play Misty for Me (1971), The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976), Pale Rider (1985), In the Line of Fire (1993), The Bridges of Madison County (1995), and Gran Torino (2008), have all received commercial success and/or critical acclaim. Eastwood's only comedies have been Every Which Way but Loose (1978) and its sequel Any Which Way You Can (1980); despite being widely panned by critics they are the two highest-grossing films of his career after adjusting for inflation.\n\nEastwood has directed most of his own star vehicles, but he has also directed films in which he did not appear such as Mystic River (2003) and Letters from Iwo Jima (2006), for which he received Academy Award nominations and Changeling (2008), which received Golden Globe Award nominations. He has received considerable critical praise in France in particular, including for several of his films which were panned in the United States, and was awarded two of France's highest honors: in 1994 he received the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres medal and in 2007 was awarded the Légion d'honneur medal. In 2000 he was awarded the Italian Venice Film Festival Golden Lion for lifetime achievement.\n\nSince 1967 Eastwood has run his own production company, Malpaso, which has produced the vast majority of his films. He also served as the nonpartisan mayor of Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, from 1986 to 1988. Eastwood has seven children by five women, although he has only married twice.

Hatchet-faced with piercing eyes, he had declined to have his nose altered to play a sympathetic character in his film debut, High Noon, and was relegated to a non-speaking outlaw as a result. For a decade he was typecast as a minor villain, his sinister features[peacock term] overshadowing his acting skills. After suffering serious injuries in a car crash, Van Cleef began to lose interest in his apparently waning[peacock term] career by the time Sergio Leone gave him a major role in For a Few Dollars More. The film made him a box-office draw, especially in Europe.\n\nMilitary service:\n\nAfter basic training and further training at the Naval Fleet Sound School, Van Cleef was assigned to a submarine chaser and then to a minesweeper, USS Incredible, on which he worked as a sonarman.\n\nfter leaving the Navy, Van Cleef read for a part in Our Town at the Little Theater Group in Clinton, New Jersey and received his first stage role.[7] From there, he continued to meet with the group and audition for parts. The next biggest part was that of the boxer, Joe Pendleton, in the play Heaven Can Wait. During this time, he was observed by visiting talent scouts, who were impressed by Van Cleef's stage presence and delivery. One of these scouts later took him to New York City talent agent Maynard Morris of the MCA agency, who then sent him to the Alvin Theater for an audition. The play was Mister Roberts.[citation needed]\n\nVan Cleef's screen debut came in High Noon. During a performance of Mister Roberts in Los Angeles, he was noticed by film director Stanley Kramer, who offered Van Cleef a role in his upcoming film. Kramer originally wanted Van Cleef for the role of the deputy Harvey Pell, but as he wanted Van Cleef to have his \"distinctive nose\" fixed, Van Cleef declined the role in favor of the part of the silent gunslinger Jack Colby. He was then cast mostly in villainous roles, due to his sharp cheeks and chin, piercing eyes, and hawk-like nose,[citation needed][peacock term] from the part of Tony Romano in Kansas City Confidential (1952), culminating 14 years later in Sergio Leone's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)\n\nDespite suffering from heart disease from the late 1970s and having a pacemaker installed in the early 1980s,[14] Van Cleef continued to work in films until his death on December 16, 1989, at age 64.[15] He collapsed in his home in Oxnard, California, from a heart attack.[16] Throat cancer was listed as a secondary cause of death.[17] He was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery, Hollywood Hills, California, with an inscription on his grave marker referring to his many acting performances as a villain: \"BEST OF THE BAD\".

After appearing on stage, Young was signed with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and, in spite of having a \"tier B\" status, he co-starred with some of the studio's most illustrious actresses, such as Katharine Hepburn, Margaret Sullavan, Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, Helen Hayes, Luise Rainer, Hedy Lamarr, and Helen Twelvetrees. Yet, most of his assignments consisted of B movies, also known as \"programmers,\" which required two to three weeks of shooting (considered very brief shooting periods at the time). Actors who were relegated to such a hectic schedule appeared, as Young did, in some six to eight movies per year.\n\nAs an MGM contract player, Young was resigned to the fate of most of his colleagues—to accept any film assigned to him or risk being placed on suspension—and many actors on suspension were prohibited from earning a salary from any endeavor at all (even those unrelated to the film industry). In 1936, MGM summarily loaned Young to Gaumont British for two films; the first was directed by Alfred Hitchcock with the other co-starring Jessie Matthews. While there he surmised that his employers intended to terminate his contract, but he was mistaken.\n\nHe unexpectedly received one of his most rewarding roles late in his MGM career, in H.M. Pulham, Esq., featuring one of Hedy Lamarr's most effective performances. He once remarked that he was assigned only those roles which Robert Montgomery and other A-list actors had rejected.\n\nAfter his contract ended at MGM, Young starred in light comedies as well as in trenchant dramas for studios such as 20th Century Fox, United Artists, and RKO Radio Pictures. From 1943, Young assayed more challenging roles in films like Claudia, The Enchanted Cottage, They Won't Believe Me, The Second Woman, and Crossfire. His portrayal of unsympathetic characters in several of these later films—which was seldom the case in his MGM pictures—was applauded by numerous reviewers.\n\nYoung's career began an incremental and imperceptible decline, despite a propitious beginning as a freelance actor without the nurturing of a major studio. He continued starring as a leading man in the late 1940s and early 1950s, but only in mediocre films, then he subsequently disappeared from the silver screen - only to reappear several years later on a much smaller one.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Robert Young (actor), licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/zsUCL3cmKSyOE2xSjXDT8v7SOYi.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>819, :name=>"Edward Norton", :dob=>"1969-08-18", :bio=>"Edward Harrison Norton (born August 18, 1969) is an American actor, screenwriter, film director and producer.

With looks and a manner strikingly reminiscent of the late James Dean, Jones came from a similar background to Dean's, but his interest in the arts began with drawing, which earned him an Art school scholarship in his teens. Jones's enjoyment of movies interested him in acting, and he began to study filmed performances, particularly those of James Dean (East of Eden) and Elvis Presley (Love Me Tender), whom he considered his first idol. After serving briefly in the United States Army (and going AWOL to visit Dean's family in Fairmount, Indiana), Jones studied painting in New York City, then began acting classes. Befriended by Frank Corsaro, who had also been a friend of Dean's, Jones (adopting the stage name Christopher) made his Broadway debut on December 17, 1961, in Tennessee Williams's The Night of the Iguana, directed by Corsaro and starring actress Shelley Winters. Winters introduced Jones to Susan Strasberg, an actress herself, and the daughter of Method acting progenitor Lee Strasberg. Jones went on to study at Strasberg's Actors Studio, and despite personal friction between Lee and himself, \"Chris\" went on to marry Susan in 1965. The couple had a daughter, named Jennifer Robin Jones, in 1966. Moving to Hollywood, Jones was cast in the title role of an ABC television series, The Legend of Jesse James (produced by 20th Century Fox), which ran for thirty-four episodes in the 1965-1966 season. When the series ended, he accepted the role of Strasberg's lover/husband in the movie Chubasco. The marriage did not long survive the filming, for the couple divorced in 1968. Jones's next acting job, as rock star and Presidential wannabe Max Frost in the 1968 cult classic Wild in the Streets (costarring Shelley Winters), propelled Jones to the peak of his stardom. He appeared later that same year with Yvette Mimieux, in the sex comedy Three in the Attic. Jones also became friends with actress Sharon Tate and her husband Roman Polanski. He claimed later to have had an affair with Tate (while she was pregnant with Polanski's child), and to have had a premonition of her death, before she was murdered by members of the Manson family.", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/9CEaGmL1hNiAxT5JdmCdAZ5OR0q.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>37832, :name=>"Kevin Mangan", :dob=>nil, :bio=>"", :image=>"https://robohash.org/Kevin Mangan?set=set3", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>29934, :name=>"Brett Rice", :dob=>nil, :bio=>"", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/4OTUfCVDOsCFQoQwiNE8deDFxKW.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>14526, :name=>"Daniel C.

Harrison Ford’s career started in 1964 when he travelled to California in search of a voice-over job. He never received that position, but instead signed a contract with Columbia Pictures where he earned $150 weekly to play small fill in roles in various films.  Through the 60’s Harrison worked on several TV shows including Gunsmoke, Ironside, Kung Fu, and American Style.  It wasn’t until 1967 that Harrison received his first credited role in the Western film, A Time for Killing. Dissatisfied with the meager roles he was being offered, Ford took a hiatus from acting to work as a self-employed carpenter. This seemingly odd diversion turned out to be a blessing in disguise for Harrison’s acting career when he was soon hired by famous film producer George Lucas.  This was a turning point in Harrison’s life that led to him be casted in milestone roles such as Hans Solo and Indiana Jones.  Since his most famous roles in the Star Wars Trilogy and Raiders of the Lost Ark, Harrison Ford has starred in over 40 films.  Many criticize his recent work, saying his performances have been lackluster leading to commercially disappointing films.  Harrison has always worked hard to protect his off-screen private life, keeping details about his children and marriages quite.  He has a total of five children including one recent adoption with third and current wife Calista Flockhart. In addition to acting Harrison Ford is passionate about environmental conservation, aviation, and archeology.", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/klPehAfaQDatLLQ8dN4lMcb4ESo.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>4, :name=>"Carrie Fisher", :dob=>"1956-10-21", :bio=>"Carrie Frances Fisher (21 October 1956 - 27 December 2016) was an American actress, novelist, screenwriter, and lecturer.

He is known for providing the voice of Darth Vader in the Star Wars franchise and the tagline for CNN.  James Earl Jones was born in Arkabutla, Mississippi, the son of Ruth (née Connolly) and Robert Earl Jones. At the age of five, he moved to Jackson, Michigan, to be raised by his maternal grandparents, but the adoption was traumatic and he developed a stutter so severe he refused to speak aloud. When he moved to Brethren, Michigan in later years a teacher at the Brethren schools started to help him with his stutter. He remained functionally mute for eight years until he reached high school. He credits his high school teacher, Donald Crouch, who discovered he had a gift for writing poetry, with helping him out of his silence.  Jones attended the University of Michigan where he was a pre-med major. While there, he joined the Reserve Officer Training Corps, and excelled. During the course of his studies, Jones discovered he was not cut out to be a doctor. Instead he focused himself on drama, with the thought of doing something he enjoyed, before, he assumed, he would have to go off to fight in the Korean War. After four years of college, Jones left without his degree. In 1953 he found a part-time stage crew job at the Ramsdell Theatre in Manistee, Michigan, which marked the beginning of his acting career. During the 1955–1957 seasons he was an actor and stage manager. He performed his first portrayal of Shakespeare’s Othello in this theater in 1955. After his discharge from the Military, Jones moved to New York, where he attended the American Theatre Wing to further his training and worked as a janitor to earn a living. His first film role was as a young and trim Lt. Lothar Zogg, the B-52 bombardier in Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb in 1964. His first big role came with his portrayal of boxer Jack Jefferson in the film version of the Broadway play The Great White Hope, which was based on the life of boxer Jack Johnson. For his role, Jones was nominated Best Actor by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, making him the second African-American male performer (following Sidney Poitier) to receive a nomination. In 1969, Jones participated in making test films for a proposed children's television series; these shorts, combined with animated segments were the beginnings of the Sesame Street format. The next year, in the early 1970s, James appeared with Diahann Carroll in the film called Claudine.  While he has appeared in many roles, he is well known as the voice of Darth Vader in the original Star Wars trilogy. Darth Vader was portrayed in costume by David Prowse in the original trilogy, with Jones dubbing Vader's dialogue in postproduction due to Prowse's strong West Country accent being unsuitable for the role. At his own request, he was originally uncredited for the release of the first two films (he would later be credited for the two in the 1997 re-release).  His other voice roles include Mufasa in the 1994 film Disney animated blockbuster The Lion King, and its direct-to-video sequel, The Lion King II: Simba's Pride. He also has done the CNN tagline, \"This is CNN\", as well as \"This is CNN International\", and the Bell Atlantic tagline, \"Bell Atlantic: The heart of communication\". When Bell Atlantic became Verizon, Jones used the tagline greeting of \"Welcome to Verizon\" or \"Verizon 411\" right before a phone call would go through. The opening for NBC's coverage of the 2000 and 2004 Summer Olympics; \"the Big PI in the Sky\" (God) in the computer game Under a Killing Moon; a Claymation film about The Creation; and several guest spots on The Simpsons.  In addition to his film and voice over work, Jones is an accomplished stage actor as well; he has won Tony awards in 1969 for The Great White Hope and in 1987 for Fences. Othello, King Lear, Oberon in A Midsummer Night's Dream, Abhorson in Measure for Measure, and Claudius in Hamlet are Shakespearean roles he has played. He received Kennedy Center Honors in 2002.  Jones has been married to actress Cecilia Hart since 1982. They have one child, Flynn Earl Jones. He was previously married to American actress/singer Julienne Marie (born March 21, 1933, Toledo, Ohio); they had no children.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Gallo was a painter in the New York City art scene showing with famed art dealer Annina Nosei, performed in a rap duo and was part of the first hip hop television broadcast Graffiti Rock, and played in an industrial band called Bohack which released an album title It Took Several Wives.\n\nIn the early 2000s, he released several solo recordings on WARP records. Gallo is known for his outspoken views and generally sarcastic nature, once stating: \"I stopped painting in 1990 at the peak of my success just to deny people my beautiful paintings; and I did it out of spite.\" Gallo was awarded the Coppa Volpi for Best Actor at the 67th Venice International Film Festival for his performance as a wordless escaping Muslim prisoner in Jerzy Skolimowski's Essential Killing.

He became a star after he was discovered working as a Tokyo shop clerk by filmmaker Masaki Kobayashi during the early 1950s. He became the favorite leading man of internationally-acclaimed director Akira Kurosawa after a well publicized fallout between Kurosawa and the legendary Toshirō Mifune. Beginning in the late 1950s, he worked with a number of Japan's best-known filmmakers, starring or co-starring in five Kurosawa films, along with significant films made by Hiroshi Teshigahara (The Face of Another), Mikio Naruse (When a Woman Ascends the Stairs), Kihachi Okamoto (Kill! and Sword of Doom), Hideo Gosha (Goyokin), Shiro Toyoda (Portrait of Hell) and Kon Ichikawa (Enjo and Odd Obsession). Notably, his long-term collaboration with Masaki Kobayashi invites comparison to the working relationship between Akira Kurosawa and Toshirō Mifune. Nakadai was featured in 11 Kobayashi films including the The Human Condition trilogy, Harakiri, Samurai Rebellion and Kwaidan. The Thick-Walled Room marked Nakadai's acting debut. His next role was a little noticed and uncredited one in Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai where he appears for a few seconds as a samurai wandering about town.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Tatsuya Nakadai, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/2rx0P5YiINQvla6bsJoAyQKNOIz.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>78496, :name=>"Ken Utsui", :dob=>"1931-10-24", :bio=>"", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/35Xj1O2xP4w6juhLmJol77I9bIk.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>931393, :name=>"Ren Yamamoto", :dob=>"1930-05-12", :bio=>"", :image=>"https://robohash.org/Ren Yamamoto?set=set3", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>12052, :name=>"Gwyneth Paltrow", :dob=>"1972-09-27", :bio=>"Gwyneth Kate Paltrow (born September 27, 1972) is an American actress, businesswoman and author.

He was born into a prominent theatrical family on October 26,  1875 in London. His father was Charles Warner, and his grandfather was  James Warner, both prominent English actors. He replaced J.B. Warner as Jesus in The King of Kings  (1927) when J.B. died of tuberculosis at age 29. (J.B. was not Henry's  brother. J.B. had taken the professional last name \"Warner\" because  Henry's family took him in.)\n\nHenry Warner's family wanted him to  become a doctor, and he graduated from London University but eventually  gave up his medical studies. The theater was in his blood, and he  studied acting in Paris and Italy before joining his father's stock  company, making his debut in the English production of \"Drink.\" It was  from his father that he honed his craft.\n\nWarner made it to  America in the early 1900s, after touring the British Empire. Billed as  Harry Warner, he made his Broadway debut in the American colonial drama  \"Audrey\" at Hoyt's Theatre on November 24, 1902, starring James O'Neill, the father of playwright Eugene O'Neill.  He was billed as H.B. Warner in his next appearance on Broadway, in the  1906 comedy \"Nurse Marjorie.\" He appeared in 13 more Broadway  productions in his career, from the twin-bill of \"Susan in Search of a  Husband\" & \"A Tenement Tragedy\" (also 1906) to \"Silence\" in 1925.\n\nHe moved into motion pictures, making his debut in the Mutual short Harp of Tara (1914). Also in 1914, he appeared in a film written by Cecil B. DeMille for Famous Players Lasky, The Ghost Breaker  (1914), in which he had played on Broadway the year before. Warner  became a leading man and a star in silent pictures, reaching the zenith  of his career playing Jesus in DeMille's The King of Kings  (1927). His excellent performance was actually enhanced by the silent  screen, allowing the audience to imagine how Jesus would sound. Warner  could be extremely moving in silent pictures, notably in the melodrama Sorrell and Son (1927) as a war veteran father who sacrifices all for his son.\n\nWhen talkies arrived, he became a busy supporting player. A favorite of Frank Capra , appeared in Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936). Cast again by Capra, he was nominated for Best Supporting Actor in Lost Horizon (1937). He also appeared in You Can't Take It with You (1938), and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939). Other major talkies included The Devil and Daniel Webster (1941) and Topper Returns (1941). Other than Jesus, the role he is best remembered role for today is in It's a Wonderful Life  (1946), in which he played Mr. Gower, the druggist who is saved from  committing a lethal medication error by the young George Bailey (the James Stewart character as a child). H.B. Warner appeared in Sunset Blvd. (1950) as himself. His last credited role was as Amminadab in DeMille's The Ten Commandments (1956), a remake of the earlier silent The Ten Commandments (1923).

Sheldon Leonard Bershad was born in Manhattan, New York City, the son of middle class Jewish parents Anna Levit and Frank Bershad. He graduated from Syracuse University in 1929.\n\nAs an actor, Leonard specialized in playing supporting characters, especially gangsters or \"heavies\", in films such as It's a Wonderful Life (1946; as bartender Nick), To Have and Have Not (1944), Guys and Dolls (1955), and Open Secret (1948). His trademark was his especially thick New York accent, usually delivered from the side of his mouth. In Decoy (1946), Leonard uses his \"heavy\" persona to create the hard-boiled police detective Joe Portugal.\n\nOn radio from 1945 to 1955, Leonard played an eccentric racetrack tout on The Jack Benny Program and later in the TV series of the same name. His role was to salute Benny out of the blue in railroad stations, on street corners, or in department stores (\"Hey Bud. C'mere a minute.\"), ask Benny what he was about to do, and then proceed to try to argue him out of his course of action by resorting to inane and irrelevant racing logic. As \"The Tout,\" he never gave out information on horse racing, unless Jack demanded it. One excuse the tout gave was, \"Who knows about horses?\"\n\nLeonard was part of the cast of voice actors on the Damon Runyon Theatre radio show (1948-1949). He was part of the ensemble cast of the Martin and Lewis radio show. He also appeared frequently on The Adventures of the Saint, often playing gangsters and heavies, but also sometimes in more positive roles. Leonard was also a regular on the radio comedy series The Adventures of Maisie in the 1940s. During the 1950s, Leonard provided the voice of lazy fat cat Dodsworth in two Warner Bros. Merrie Melodies cartoons directed by Robert McKimson.  In the adventure movie The Iroquois Trail (1950), Leonard played against type in the significant role of Chief Ogane, a Native American warrior, who pursues and fights the frontiersman Nat \"Hawkeye\" Cutler (George Montgomery) in a climactic duel to the death with knives.\n\nLater in the 1950s and 1960s, he established a reputation as a producer of successful television series, including The Danny Thomas Show (aka Make Room For Daddy) (1953–64), The Andy Griffith Show (1960–68), Gomer Pyle U.S.M.C. (1964–69), The Dick Van Dyke Show (1961–66), and I Spy (1965–68). He also directed several TV series episodes, including four of the first eight episodes of the TV series Lassie (Season 1, 1954). Leonard also provided the voice of Linus the Lionhearted in a series of Post Crispy Critters cereal TV commercials in 1963-64, which led to a Linus cartoon series that aired on Saturday (and later, Sunday) mornings on CBS (1964–66) and ABC (1967–69).

He would have his first memorable bit in his next film, Destry Rides Again, starring Marlene Dietrich and James Stewart, where in the opening scene he is playing cards, and is cheated when Dietrich distracts him by spilling coffee in his lap. His film career would span almost forty years, and encompass over 90 films, mostly in small or supporting roles, although with an occasional starring role, as in 1940's Zanzibar. The 1940s would see him appear in other classic and notable films such as: the Bob Hope comedy, My Favorite Blonde (1942); Pardon My Sarong (1942), starring the comedy team of Abbott and Costello; The Naughty Nineties (1945), again starring Abbott and Costello; the film noir, The Big Sleep (1946), starring Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall; and 1946's It's a Wonderful Life, where he had a particularly memorable scene as the Tollhouse Keeper on the bridge, who reacts to Clarence's (the angel) explanation of who he is to George Bailey (James Stewart).\n\nThe 1950s would see Fadden continue to appear in several notable films, including: Dallas (1950), starring Gary Cooper and Ruth Roman; 1956's Invasion of the Body Snatchers, where his character is one of the first victims to succumb to the alien invaders; and Baby Face Nelson (1957), starring Mickey Rooney and Carolyn Jones. Fadden would also begin forays into the acting world of the small screen.

Farrell MacDonald", :dob=>"1875-06-06", :bio=>"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJohn Farrell MacDonald (June 6, 1875 – August 2, 1952) was an American character actor and director. He played supporting roles and occasional leads. He appeared in over 325 films over a 41-year career from 1911 to 1951, and directed forty-four silent films from 1912 to 1917.\n\nMacDonald was the principal director of L. Frank Baum's Oz Film Manufacturing Company, and he can frequently be seen in the films of Frank Capra, Preston Sturges and, especially, John Ford.\n\nEarly in his career, MacDonald was a singer in minstrel shows, and he toured the United States extensively for two years with stage productions. He made his first silent film in 1911, a dramatic short entitled The Scarlett Letter made by Carl Laemmle's Independent Moving Pictures Company (IMP), the forerunner of Universal Pictures,. He continued to act in numerous films each year from that time on, and by 1912 he was directing them as well. The first film he directed was The Worth of a Man, another dramatic short, again for IMP, and he was to direct 43 more films until his last in 1917, Over the Fence, which he co-directed with Harold Lloyd. MacDonald had crossed paths with Lloyd several years earlier, when Lloyd was an extra and MacDonald had given him much-needed work – and he did the same with Hal Roach, both of whom appearing in small roles in The Patchwork Girl of Oz, which MacDonald directed in 1914. When Roach set up his own studio, with Lloyd as his principal attraction, he hired MacDonald to direct.\n\nBy 1918, MacDonald, who was to become one of the most beloved character men in Hollywood, had given up directing and was acting full-time, predominantly in Westerns and Irish comedies. He first worked under director John Ford in 1919's A Fight for Love. In all, Ford would use MacDonald on twenty-five films between 1919 and 1950.\n\nWith a voice that matched his personality, MacDonald made the transition to sound films easily, with no noticeable drop in his acting output – if anything, it went up. In 1931, for instance, MacDonald appeared in 14 films – among them the first version of The Maltese Falcon, in which he played \"Detective Tom Polhaus\" – and in 22 of them in 1932. Although he played laborers, policemen, military men and priests, among many other characters, his roles were usually a cut above a \"bit part\". His characters usually had names, and he was most often credited for his performances. A highlight of this period was his performance as the hobo \"Mr. Tramp\" in Our Little Girl with Shirley Temple (1935).\n\nIn the 1940s, MacDonald was part of Preston Sturges' unofficial \"stock company\" of character actors, appearing in seven films written and directed by Sturges. MacDonald appeared in Sullivan's Travels, The Palm Beach Story, The Miracle of Morgan's Creek, The Great Moment, The Sin of Harold Diddlebock, Unfaithfully Yours and The Beautiful Blonde from Bashful Bend, Sturges' last American film. Earlier, MacDonald had also appeared in The Power and the Glory, which Sturges wrote. His work on Sturges' films was generally uncredited. He was notable in 1946 in John Ford's My Darling Clementine in which he played \"Mac,\" the bartender in the town saloon. MacDonald also had uncredited roles in It's a Wonderful Life and Here Comes The Groom.", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/jOVuvlM8q1DN0ZJ53tR1goIEaHv.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>1731319, :name=>"Irene Mack", :dob=>nil, :bio=>"", :image=>"https://robohash.org/Irene Mack?set=set3", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>121327, :name=>"Wilbur Mack", :dob=>"1873-07-29", :bio=>"Wilbur Mack (born George Frear Runyon, 29 July 1873 – 13 March 1964) was an American film actor and early vaudeville performer from the 1920s through the 1960s.

His appearances include roles in such widely-known films as Dr. Strangelove (1964), Rollerball (1975), The Spy Who Loved Me (1977), Gandhi (1982), Out of Africa (1985) and Crusoe (1989). More recently he has appeared in Spy Game (2001), and Batman Begins (2005). In the earlier years of his career, there were several uncredited performances, among others for films such as You Only Live Twice (1967), Diamonds Are Forever (1971), Star Wars (1977) and Superman II (1980). With the exception of recurring featured cast members he has appeared in more James Bond films than any other actor.\n\nRimmer has a long association with Gerry Anderson. Thunderbirds fans may recognize him as the voice actor behind the character Scott Tracy. He drafted the plotline for the penultimate episode, \"Ricochet\", which was later turned into a script by Tony Barwick. He also wrote scripts and provided uncredited voices for Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons, Joe 90 and The Secret Service, has made appearances in episodes of Anderson's live-action UFO and The Protectors, has and provided voices for Space: 1999 and has guest-starred in the episode \"Space Brain\". In later years he starred in the unscreened pilot Space Police (later made into a series with other actors and titled Space Precinct) and provided the voice for Anderson's stop-motion gumshoe Dick Spanner, P.I..\n\nRimmer and fellow Anderson actor Ed Bishop often joked about how often their professional paths crossed and termed themselves \"Rent-a-Yanks\". They appeared together as NASA operatives in the opening of You Only Live Twice and as USN sailors in The Bedford Incident as well as touring together in live stage shows, including \"Death of a Salesman\" in the 1990s. He also appeared in Doctor Who in 1966, and in Coronation Street as two different characters: Joe Donnelli (1968–1970), who held Stan Ogden hostage in No. 5 before committing suicide, and Malcolm Reid (1988), father of Audrey Roberts' son Stephen.\n\nHe has made many guest appearances in British television series for ITV, including in Roald Dahl's Tales of the Unexpected, and ITC's The Persuaders!. In 1989 Rimmer was reunited with former Gerry Anderson actors Ed Bishop and Matt Zimmerman in the BBC Radio 4 adaptation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's A Study In Scarlet. Rimmer and Bishop also appeared in the BBC drama-documentary Hiroshima completed not long after Bishop's death in 2005. Note: His official website and travel record on the Immigration & Travel section of Ancestry give his year of birth as 1929.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Shane Rimmer, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/morFcla0R2Bv3vu3B1HgCmm0eiv.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>1271116, :name=>"Pam Rose", :dob=>nil, :bio=>"", :image=>"https://robohash.org/Pam Rose?set=set3", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>110319, :name=>"George Roubicek", :dob=>"1935-05-25", :bio=>"", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/rst8SIBPenI8lmvwIwK0GcJ4d3x.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>1271121, :name=>"Erica Simmons", :dob=>nil, :bio=>"", :image=>"https://robohash.org/Erica Simmons?set=set3", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>1271122, :name=>"Angela Staines", :dob=>nil, :bio=>"", :image=>"https://robohash.org/Angela Staines?set=set3", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>1271123, :name=>"George Stock", :dob=>nil, :bio=>"", :image=>"https://robohash.org/George Stock?set=set3", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>1271124, :name=>"Roy Straite", :dob=>nil, :bio=>"", :image=>"https://robohash.org/Roy Straite?set=set3", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>1271125, :name=>"Peter Sturgeon", :dob=>nil, :bio=>"", :image=>"https://robohash.org/Peter Sturgeon?set=set3", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>187398, :name=>"Peter Sumner", :dob=>"1942-01-29", :bio=>"", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/6jxSgwF82SrGtZPn0gbLhH9zeTR.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>1271126, :name=>"John Sylla", :dob=>nil, :bio=>"", :image=>"https://robohash.org/John Sylla?set=set3", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>390158, :name=>"Tom Sylla", :dob=>nil, :bio=>"", :image=>"https://robohash.org/Tom Sylla?set=set3", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>166258, :name=>"Malcolm Tierney", :dob=>"1938-02-25", :bio=>"", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/nDjDgg9dTISkUGOWnMQ1Ng2E4FO.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>7727, :name=>"Phil Tippett", :dob=>nil, :bio=>"", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/qIjrlRrM6MwNkbCYwRbPYbvq9P7.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>160947, :name=>"Morgan Upton", :dob=>"1930-08-11", :bio=>"", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/n8fCBnBSFoPSGxOT4FN2kn5wmtz.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>161301, :name=>"Jerry Walter", :dob=>nil, :bio=>"", :image=>"https://robohash.org/Jerry Walter?set=set3", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>1271127, :name=>"Hal Wamsley", :dob=>nil, :bio=>"", :image=>"https://robohash.org/Hal Wamsley?set=set3", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>159108, :name=>"Larry Ward", :dob=>"1924-10-03", :bio=>"", :image=>"https://robohash.org/Larry Ward?set=set3", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>1271128, :name=>"Diana Sadley Way", :dob=>nil, :bio=>"", :image=>"https://robohash.org/Diana Sadley Way?set=set3", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>24278, :name=>"Bill Weston", :dob=>"1941-05-29", :bio=>"", :image=>"https://robohash.org/Bill Weston?set=set3", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>1271131, :name=>"Fred Wood", :dob=>"1922-10-26", :bio=>"Fred Wood (born 26 October 1922, Rotherhithe, London), died January 2003, was an English actor.\n\nWood was best known for roles in Star Wars (1977), Elephant Man (1980) and From Russia with Love (1963).

His career reoriented away from classical music to musical theatre in 1960 after Meredith Willson cast him in the lead role of his new Broadway musical The Unsinkable Molly Brown. His portrayal of \"Leadville Johnny\" was a resounding success and he reprised the role in the 1964 film version of the musical, winning a Golden Globe Award for his portrayal.\n\nPresnell went on to star in a few more films during the 1960s, but by the early 1970s that aspect of his career came to a standstill. From 1970 to 1995 he mostly worked as a musical theatre performer on Broadway, the West End, and in touring productions out of New York. In his early 60s, Presnell saw a resurgence in his movie career which lasted until his death.

When Sam was five years old, his parents separated, at which point he and his father moved to San Francisco, where he subsequently grew up, while summers and other times were spent with his mother in New York.\n\nHe made his acting debut when he was ten years old, alongside his mother, and later attended J Eugene McAteer High School in a program called SOTA. While still in high school, he got his first big break when he appeared in the independent film Clownhouse (1989). The plot revolved around three escaped mental patients who dressed up as clowns and terrorized three brothers home alone--Sam played the eldest of the brothers. His next big break was supposed to have come when he was slated to star in a short-lived NBC TV-series called Dream Street (1989), but he was soon fired.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Sam returned to New York for good and for two years he had private training at the William Esper Acting Studio. During this period he appeared in a variety of roles, such as the ABC Afterschool Specials (1972): Over the Limit (1990) (TV) and HBO's Lifestories: Families in Crisis (1992): Dead Drunk: The Kevin Tunell Story (Season 1 Episode 7: 15 March 1993); the head thug in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990); and a guest-star turn in an Emmy Award-winning episode of Law & Order (1990), while working a string of regular day jobs and performing in plays.\n\nAfter a few smaller appearances in films such as Woody Allen's Celebrity (1998) and the modern version of A Midsummer Night's Dream (1999), in which he played Francis Flute, he had larger roles in two of the bigger hit movies to emerge: The Green Mile (1999) and Galaxy Quest (1999), wowing audiences and critics alike with his chameleon-like performances as a crazed killer in the former and a goofy actor in the latter.\n\nMore recently, he appeared in another string of mainstream films, most notably as Eric Knox in Charlie's Angels (2000) and as Zaphod Beeblebrox in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (2005), while continuing to perform in smaller independent movies.

She achieved great success in a variety of film roles and won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in Kitty Foyle.  After winning a 1925 Charleston dance contest that launched a successful vaudeville career, she gained recognition as a Broadway actress for her stage debut in Girl Crazy. This led to a contract with Paramount Pictures, which ended after five films. Rogers had her first successful film role as a supporting actress in 42nd Street.\n\nIn the 1930s, Rogers' nine films with Fred Astaire gave RKO Pictures some of its biggest successes, most notably Top Hat and Swing Time. But after two commercial failures with Astaire, she branched out into dramatic and comedy films. Her acting was well received by critics and audiences, and she became one of the biggest box-office draws and highest paid actresses of the 1940s. Her performance in Kitty Foyle won her the Oscar for Best Actress.\n\nRogers' popularity peaked by the end of the decade. She reunited with Astaire in 1949 in the commercially successful The Barkleys of Broadway. After an unsuccessful period in the 1950s, she returned to Broadway in 1965, playing the lead role in Hello, Dolly!. More Broadway roles followed, along with her stage directorial debut in 1985 of an off-Broadway production of Babes in Arms. She also made television acting appearances until 1987. In 1992, Rogers was recognized at the Kennedy Center Honors. She died of a heart attack in 1995, at age 83.\n\nRogers is associated with the phrase \"backwards and in high heels\", which is attributed to Bob Thaves' Frank and Ernest 1982 cartoon with the caption \"Sure he [Astaire] was great, but don't forget that Ginger Rogers did everything he did...backwards and in high heels\". This phrase is sometimes incorrectly attributed to Ann Richards, who used it in her keynote address to the 1988 Democratic National Convention.\n\nA Republican and a devout Christian Scientist, Rogers married five times with all of them ending in divorce, and having no children. During her long career, Rogers made 73 films, and her musical films with Astaire are credited with revolutionizing the genre. Rogers was a major movie star during the \"Golden Age\" of Hollywood and is often considered an American icon. She ranks number 14 on the AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars list of female stars of classic American cinema. Her autobiography Ginger: My Story was published in 1991.", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/ah4nyaNUOMZwmGbDOAtN8S8J6ap.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>1609086, :name=>"Garth Shaw", :dob=>nil, :bio=>"", :image=>"https://robohash.org/Garth Shaw?set=set3", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>1742176, :name=>"Jared Stovall", :dob=>nil, :bio=>"", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/hSO4lmx3yEM8hVvbD1PNass0rlq.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>174205, :name=>"Todd Thompson", :dob=>nil, :bio=>"", :image=>"https://robohash.org/Todd Thompson?set=set3", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>10297, :name=>"Matthew McConaughey", :dob=>"1969-11-04", :bio=>"Matthew David McConaughey (born November 4, 1969) is an American actor.

He was among the children saved from the Holocaust by the OSE, but his mother died in Auschwitz. He studied acting at the Cours Simon and started his career on stage under the name Jean Herbert.\n\nIn 1968, Herpstu created the character of Popeck, a grumpy Eastern-European immigrant dressed in a 3-piece suit, wearing a bowler hat and speaking French with a strong Yiddish accent. Sketches featuring Popeck made Herpstu known to the larger public, and the actor identified with his character so far as to finally adopt the name Popeck for himself in 1978.\n\nIn addition to his work on stage, Popeck has acted in movies. He had a small role in Roman Polanski's The Pianist.\n\nSource: Article \"Popeck\" from Wikipedia in english, licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0.", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/eBKbS1aHfIeYTE76xZ0L6uK1stY.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>1138495, :name=>"Zofia Czerwińska", :dob=>"1933-03-19", :bio=>"", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/Qlt18KDV4Y9LR0pboqRoITTkUQ.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>48392, :name=>"Udo Kroschwald", :dob=>"1955-01-01", :bio=>"", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/lR8CWHpmPt9qQ0Gv1lp3eLOXRAd.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>1537160, :name=>"Uwe Rathsam", :dob=>nil, :bio=>"", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/eYutcXBLdzQy3pk9okcRhHfPvdN.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>107874, :name=>"Joanna Brodzik", :dob=>"1973-01-11", :bio=>"", :image=>"https://robohash.org/Joanna Brodzik?set=set3", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>1076083, :name=>"Katarzyna Bargiełowska", :dob=>"1962-03-17", :bio=>"", :image=>"https://robohash.org/Katarzyna Bargiełowska?set=set3", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>47547, :name=>"John Bennett", :dob=>"1928-05-08", :bio=>"", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/arSkPpoGcRyqSdx4iAE9DtBc2Z8.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>24722, :name=>"Cyril Shaps", :dob=>"1923-10-13", :bio=>"", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/rNfjiJV77Vf2PsctHFlL3mUOZDz.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>945055, :name=>"Wojciech Smolarz", :dob=>nil, :bio=>"", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/5N5F6tjT0NIMPNs6OrBP0Ky2ja1.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>1275339, :name=>"Lech Mackiewicz", :dob=>nil, :bio=>"", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/grSwuTaSQX8uPIh7EOQXsDXtqtr.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>181029, :name=>"Ruth Platt", :dob=>nil, :bio=>"", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/n9Wmwf6ly9sfdWN1nMxlxRUYL05.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>21837, :name=>"Peter Rappenglück", :dob=>"1962-01-03", :bio=>"", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/n8UDvmmWpaNqxt877WexVhcp8MM.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>20523, :name=>"Ronan Vibert", :dob=>"1964-01-01", :bio=>"", :image=>"https://robohash.org/Ronan Vibert?set=set3", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>24524, :name=>"Krzysztof Pieczyński", :dob=>"1957-03-27", :bio=>"", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/8mF7zVX066MEo2YrMGF0zeioDpv.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>83264, :name=>"Katarzyna Figura", :dob=>"1962-03-22", :bio=>"", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/bNQfrhXUZZ6v1e79eke2z2C9fBD.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>52375, :name=>"Valentine Pelka", :dob=>"1957-02-23", :bio=>"", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/3Y74phXaon2ZLEXu9y5t8QENyvt.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>17290, :name=>"Andrew Tiernan", :dob=>"1965-11-30", :bio=>"Andrew James Tiernan is an English film and television actor.", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/co8FxSWaRuYW3bhsJBTXO3GNkdg.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>1533548, :name=>"Tom Strauss", :dob=>nil, :bio=>"", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/7xlQUTkaovdm6CTNlmJDhKJWlkX.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>146434, :name=>"Cezary Kosiński", :dob=>"1973-04-08", :bio=>"Cezary Kosinski is a Polish film and television actor.

Following his 1906 role in the highly successful play The Chorus Lady, he was recruited to the fledgling Biograph Studios by D. W. Griffith.\n\nAt the time, the film business was still looked down upon by many members of the theatrical community. In her 1925 book titled When the Movies Were Young, Griffith's wife, actress Linda Arvidson, told the story of the early days at Biograph Studios. In it, she referred to Lucas as the \"first real grand actor, democratic enough to work in Biograph movies.\" In 1908 Lucas made his motion picture debut in Griffith's The Greaser's Gauntlet, appearing in more than 50 of these short (usually 17 minutes) films over the next two years.\n\nIn 1910 while still acting, he wrote the script for Griffith's film Sunshine Sue, which was followed by many more scripts by 1924. Lucas also began directing in 1912 with Griffith on An Outcast Among Outcasts, and directed another 44 films over the next 20 years.\n\nIn early 1916 he starred as John Carter in Acquitted, about which Photoplay wrote, \"No single performance in the records of active photography has surpassed his visualization of the humble book-keeper in Acquitted.\" Later in 1916 he appeared in D.W. Griffith's film Intolerance.\n\nPart of the group of Canadian pioneers in early Hollywood, Lucas became friends and sometimes starred with Mary Pickford, Sam De Grasse, and Marie Dressler. Canadian-born director Mack Sennett hired him to both direct and act in a large number of films at his Keystone Studios.\n\nLucas made the successful transition from silent film to sound. While working in Hollywood, in 1926 he returned to the stage, performing in several Broadway plays. He later appeared as a foil for Laurel and Hardy in their feature films Pardon Us and A Chump at Oxford.\n\nDuring his long career, Wilfred Lucas appeared in more than 375 films.

In Don't Bother to Knock (1952) she portrayed a mother who lets a disturbed Marilyn Monroe babysit her daughter. The next year she appeared again with Marilyn in Niagara, as Mrs. Kettering.

He pioneered many techniques in the suspense and psychological thriller genres. After a successful career in his native United Kingdom in both silent films and early talkies, Hitchcock moved to Hollywood. In 1956 he became an American citizen while remaining a British subject. Over a career spanning more than half a century, Hitchcock fashioned for himself a distinctive and recognizable directorial style. He pioneered the use of a camera made to move in a way that mimics a person's gaze, forcing viewers to engage in a form of voyeurism. He framed shots to maximize anxiety, fear, or empathy, and used innovative film editing. His stories frequently feature fugitives on the run from the law alongside “icy blonde” female characters. Many of Hitchcock's films have twist endings and thrilling plots featuring depictions of violence, murder, and crime, although many of the mysteries function as decoys or MacGuffins meant only to serve thematic elements in the film and the extremely complex psychological examinations of the characters. Hitchcock's films also borrow many themes from psychoanalysis and feature strong sexual undertones. Through his cameo appearances in his own films, interviews, film trailers, and the television program Alfred Hitchcock Presents, he became a cultural icon. Hitchcock directed more than fifty feature films in a career spanning six decades. Often regarded as the greatest British filmmaker, he came first in a 2007 poll of film critics in Britain's Daily Telegraph, which said: “Unquestionably the greatest filmmaker to emerge from these islands, Hitchcock did more than any director to shape modern cinema, which would be utterly different without him. His flair was for narrative, cruelly withholding crucial information (from his characters and from us) and engaging the emotions of the audience like no one else.” The magazine MovieMaker has described him as the most influential filmmaker of all-time, and he is widely regarded as one of cinema's most significant artists.", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/108fiNM6poRieMg7RIqLJRxdAwG.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>1844168, :name=>"Paul Jasmin", :dob=>"1935-04-15", :bio=>"", :image=>"https://robohash.org/Paul Jasmin?set=set3", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>2492916, :name=>"Lee Kass", :dob=>nil, :bio=>"", :image=>"https://robohash.org/Lee Kass?set=set3", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>117602, :name=>"Frank Killmond", :dob=>"1934-01-15", :bio=>"", :image=>"https://robohash.org/Frank Killmond?set=set3", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>71146, :name=>"Ted Knight", :dob=>"1923-12-07", :bio=>"Ted Knight (1923–1986) was an American actor best known for The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Too Close for Comfort, and Caddyshack.", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/KQ1T3PD20c238GYwBQt6Ph7sFZ.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>151550, :name=>"Pat McCaffrie", :dob=>"1919-01-12", :bio=>"", :image=>"https://robohash.org/Pat McCaffrie?set=set3", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>1469587, :name=>"Hans Moebus", :dob=>nil, :bio=>"", :image=>"https://robohash.org/Hans Moebus?set=set3", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>7520, :name=>"Jeanette Nolan", :dob=>"1911-12-30", :bio=>"", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/qKldTH1vE5FYRDWmpSMqy1OSd5e.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>1422376, :name=>"Lillian O'Malley", :dob=>nil, :bio=>"", :image=>"https://robohash.org/Lillian O'Malley?set=set3", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>938901, :name=>"Robert Osborne", :dob=>"1932-05-03", :bio=>"Robert Osborne was longtime (and the original) primary host of Turner Classic Movies (TCM) cable television channel.

She married an English earl in the 1940s, and is also known as Virginia Child-Villiers, Countess of Jersey. Virginia Cherrill was born on a farm in rural Carthage, Illinois, to James E. and Blanche (née Wilcox) Cherrill. She was a Chicago society girl with no thoughts of a film career when she went to Hollywood for a visit and met Charlie Chaplin when he sat next to her at a boxing match. He had failed to find the girl he wanted for his film but decided she would do and cast her in City Lights in which she gave the performance for which she is remembered, although her working relationship with Chaplin on the film was often strained. As indicated in the documentary Unknown Chaplin, Cherrill was in fact fired from the film at one point and Chaplin planned to refilm all her scenes with Georgia Hale, but ultimately realized too much money had already been spent on the picture; as Cherrill recalls in the documentary, close friend Marion Davies suggested Cherrill hold out for more money when Chaplin asked her to return to the film, and she did. She appeared in a few other films subsequently, including the 1931 Gershwin musical Delicious with Janet Gaynor, but gave up her movie career in 1936 after Troubled Waters. Cherrill married four times; her second husband was actor Cary Grant (from 1934 to 1935), and her third was George Child-Villiers, 9th Earl of Jersey (from 1937 to 1946). Her longest marriage was to Florian Martini, with whom she lived in Santa Barbara, California from 1948 until her death at age 88; she had no children. She is a part of stars of Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1545 Vine Street.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Virginia Cherrill   licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/d2Mrbpgi9XYPrtGCFKoYYOwmEE6.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>13853, :name=>"Florence Lee", :dob=>"1888-03-12", :bio=>"​From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.  \n\nFlorence Lee (March 12, 1888 – September 1, 1962) was an American actress of the silent era.

He was the brother of actor William Austin. He was born in Birmingham, England, and was a music hall performer before coming to the U.S. with Chaplin, both as members of the Fred Karno troupe, in 1910. Noted for his painted handlebar mustache and acerbic manner, he worked for Chaplin's stock company and played supporting roles in many of his films, often as a foil to the star, and working as his assistant director. After the development of sound films, he moved into scriptwriting, directing and acting, chiefly in comedy short subjects. Among other things, he assisted Chaplin in developing the plot of The Adventurer (1917). However, he only received screen credit as a collaborator once, for City Lights. As an actor, he appeared in Chaplin's comedies for the Mutual Film Corporation. Later he had two brief, uncredited roles in one of Chaplin's 'silent' comedies made in the sound era, City Lights (1931). Austin is also seen very briefly (as a cab driver) at the beginning of Chaplin's short film One A.M.. He also appeared in movies starring Jackie Coogan and Mack Sennett. Austin's best known performance may be in Chaplin's short The Pawnshop. Austin enters the shop with an alarm clock, hoping to pawn it. To establish the clock's value, Chaplin dissects it. Austin maintains a deadpan expression as Chaplin progressively destroys his clock, then hands the pieces back to Austin. He had the leading role in Mary Pickford's Suds (1920), where he co-stars as a customer leaving his shirt at her laundry. In that film he appears without his comic mustache.

He received an Academy Award for Film Editing for the 1947 film, Body and Soul.\n\nParrish was the son of factory cashier Gordon R. Parrish and Laura R. Parrish. In the mid-1920s, the family moved from Georgia to Los Angeles and Parrish and his sisters Beverly and Helen began obtaining work as actors soon thereafter. Parrish made his film debut in the 1927 Our Gang short Olympic Games. (Their mother, Laura R. Parrish, was an actress as well and appeared in a few films of the 1940s.) He appeared in the anti-war classic All Quiet on the Western Front (1930) and Charles Chaplin's City Lights (1931), and in several films for John Ford.\n\nFord then enlisted him as an assistant editor in 1936 on Mary of Scotland, and as a sound editor on Young Mr Lincoln (1939). Parrish worked as an assistant editor and sound editor on other Ford movies as Drums Along the Mohawk (1939) and The Grapes of Wrath (1940). Parrish and Ford were in the United States Navy during the Second World War, and worked on documentary and training films including The Battle of Midway (1942).\n\nIn 1947 he won an Oscar for his debut as a feature film editor on Robert Rossen's high tempo boxing drama Body and Soul; the award was shared with Francis Lyon. Parrish was later nominated for another Rossen film – the political drama All the King’s Men (1949); he shared the nomination with Al Clark.\n\nParrish went on to contribute his technical talents to a host of highly regarded films and made a promising directorial debut in 1951 with the gripping revenge melodrama, Cry Danger. His subsequent output met with varying success. The Purple Plain (1954) was nominated for \"Best British film\" at the 8th British Academy Film Awards. One of the most notorious of his films was the James Bond Parody Casino Royale (1967), in which he was one of the film's five directors. His last film, on which he shared co-director credit with Bertrand Tavernier, was Mississippi Blues (1983).\n\nParrish wrote two memoirs, Growing Up in Hollywood (1976) and its sequel Hollywood Doesn't Live Here Anymore (1988). Of the first, Kevin Brownlow wrote, \"His stories about these pictures were marvellous in themselves, and he often came at them sideways, so not only the punchline but the situation took you by surprise. We all entreated him to write them down and in 1976 he did so, producing one of the most enchanting - and hilarious - books about the picture business ever written. It was called Growing Up in Hollywood and it ought to be reprinted in this centenary year.\" Summing up Parrish's career, Allen Grant Richards wrote, \"Other than his excellent editing work and early directing, Parrish may be most remembered as storyteller from his two books of Hollywood memoirs.\"", :image=>"https://robohash.org/Robert Parrish?set=set3", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>128165, :name=>"W.C.

Strong's mother had his name legally changed when he was young in order to help him better assimilate with his peers. Although Americans are most familiar with Strong's roles as Sinestro in Green Lantern (2011), mob boss Frank D'Amico in Kick-Ass (2010), and Lord Blackthorn in Sherlock Holmes (2009), British audiences know him from his long history as a television actor. He also starred in as numerous British stage productions, including plays at the Royal National Theatre and the RSC.  His most prominent television parts include Prime Suspect 3 (1993) (TV) and Prime Suspect 6: The Last Witness (2003) (TV) as Inspector Larry Hall, and starring roles in the BBC Two dramas \"Our Friends in the North\" (1996) and \"The Long Firm\" (2004), the latter of which netted Strong a BAFTA nomination. He also played Mr. Knightley in the 1996 adaptation of Jane Austen's classic tale Emma (1996) (TV). Strong resides in London with his wife Liza Marshall, with whom he has two sons, the younger of which is the godson of his longtime friend Daniel Craig.", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/umZDzjjfL6RTUsOWRaC2CS0hNL2.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>98009, :name=>"Tiny Ward", :dob=>nil, :bio=>"", :image=>"https://robohash.org/Tiny Ward?set=set3", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>1019389, :name=>"Stanhope Wheatcroft", :dob=>nil, :bio=>"", :image=>"https://robohash.org/Stanhope Wheatcroft?set=set3", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>1269827, :name=>"Florence Wix", :dob=>nil, :bio=>"", :image=>"https://robohash.org/Florence Wix?set=set3", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>1518443, :name=>"Granville Redmond", :dob=>nil, :bio=>"", :image=>"https://robohash.org/Granville Redmond?set=set3", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>13240, :name=>"Mark Wahlberg", :dob=>"1971-06-05", :bio=>"Mark Robert Michael Wahlberg (born June 5, 1971) is an American actor, film and television producer, and former rapper.

He was a figure in popular music for over five decades, regarded by critics and musicians as an innovator, particularly for his work in the 1970s. His career was marked by reinvention and visual presentation, his music and stagecraft significantly influencing popular music. During his lifetime, his record sales, estimated at 140 million worldwide, made him one of the world's best-selling music artists. In the UK, he was awarded nine platinum album certifications, eleven gold and eight silver, releasing eleven number-one albums. In the US, he received five platinum and seven gold certifications. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996.\n\nBorn and raised in South London, Bowie developed an interest in music as a child, eventually studying art, music and design before embarking on a professional career as a musician in 1963. \"Space Oddity\" became his first top-five entry on the UK Singles Chart after its release in July 1969. After a period of experimentation, he re-emerged in 1972 during the glam rock era with his flamboyant and androgynous alter ego Ziggy Stardust. The character was spearheaded by the success of his single \"Starman\" and album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, which won him widespread popularity. In 1975, Bowie's style shifted radically towards a sound he characterised as \"plastic soul\", initially alienating many of his UK devotees but garnering him his first major US crossover success with the number-one single \"Fame\" and the album Young Americans. In 1976, Bowie starred in the cult film The Man Who Fell to Earth and released Station to Station. The following year, he further confounded musical expectations with the electronic-inflected album Low (1977), the first of three collaborations with Brian Eno that would come to be known as the \"Berlin Trilogy\". \"Heroes\" (1977) and Lodger (1979) followed; each album reached the UK top five and received lasting critical praise.\n\nAfter uneven commercial success in the late 1970s, Bowie had UK number ones with the 1980 single \"Ashes to Ashes\", its parent album Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps), and \"Under Pressure\", a 1981 collaboration with Queen. He then reached his commercial peak in 1983 with Let's Dance, with its title track topping both UK and US charts. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles, including industrial and jungle. Bowie also continued acting; his roles included Major Celliers in Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence (1983), the Goblin King Jareth in Labyrinth (1986), Pontius Pilate in The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), and Nikola Tesla in The Prestige (2006), among other film and television appearances and cameos. He stopped concert touring after 2004 and his last live performance was at a charity event in 2006. In 2013, Bowie returned from a decade-long recording hiatus with the release of The Next Day. He remained musically active until he died of liver cancer two days after the release of his final album, Blackstar (2016).", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/7OIa363iSLG43x9Sb9HojUANwbh.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>15555, :name=>"Piper Perabo", :dob=>"1976-10-31", :bio=>"Piper Lisa Perabo (born October 31, 1976) is a Golden Globe Award nominated American stage, film and television actress.

He has more than 160 credits to his name across film, television and stage. His career was at its peak in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nA prominent figure in Italian cinema since the 1950s, Ferzetti's first leading role came in 1950 in the film Lo Zappatore. He portrayed Puccini twice in 1953 and 1954 in the films Puccini and Casa Ricordi respectively. Ferzetti made his international breakthrough in 1960 in his most acclaimed role as an oversexed, restless playboy in Michelangelo Antonioni's controversial L'avventura. After a series of romantic performances, he acquired a reputation in Italy as an elegant, debonair and a somewhat aristocrat-looking leading man.\n\nIn 1966, Ferzetti starred as Lot in John Huston's biblical epic, The Bible: In the Beginning. In 1968, he played railroad baron Morton in Sergio Leone's celebrated Once Upon a Time in the West. A year later, he appeared in the James Bond movie On Her Majesty's Secret Service as Marc Ange Draco, perhaps his best known role internationally, though his voice was dubbed by British actor David de Keyser. He is well- known to non-mainstream audiences for the role that he played as the psychiatrist, Hans, in Liliana Cavani's arthouse classic The Night Porter (1974). In the 1970s he appeared in a significant number of crime films, often as an Inspector. He also appeared in Julia and Julia, opposite Sir Laurence Olivier in Inchon (1982) and the cult film First Action Hero.

He directed the 1982 adaption of Les Misérables, and appeared in Vice and Virtue, Le Casse, Les Uns et les Autres and Venus Beauty Institute. His most recent roles include starring as Michèle Mercier's husband in the Angélique series and as a Catholic priest who falls in love with Claude Jade and becomes a communist in Prêtres interdits (Forbidden Priests) in 1973.\n\nHossein started directing films in 1956 with Les salauds vont en enfer from a story by Frédéric Dard whose novels and plays went on to furnish Hossein with much of his later film material. Right from the start Hossein established his characteristic trademarks: using a seemingly straightforward suspense plot and subverting its conventions (sometimes to the extent of a complete disregard of the traditional demand for a final twist or revelation) in order to concentrate on ritualistic relationships. This is the director's running preoccupation which is always stressed in his films by an extraordinary command of film space and often striking frame compositions where the geometry of human figures and set design is used to accentuate the psychological set-up of the scene. The mechanisms of guilt and the way it destroys relationships is another recurring theme, presumably influenced by Hossein's lifelong interest in the works of Dostoyevski.\n\nAlthough Hossein had some modest international successes with films like Toi, le venin and Le vampire de Dusseldorf, he was much singled out for scorching criticism by the critics and followers of the New Wave for the unashamedly melodramatic frameworks of his films. The fact that he was essentially an auteur director with a consistent set of themes and an extraordinary mastery of original and unusual approaches to staging his stories, was never appreciated. He was not averse to trying his hand at widely different genres and was never defeated, making the strikingly different spaghetti western Une corde, un Colt and the low-budgeted but daringly subversive period drama J'ai tué Raspoutine. However, because of the lack of wider success and continuing adverse criticism, Hossein virtually ended his film directing career in 1970, having concentrated on theatre where his achievements were never questioned, and subsequently returning to film directing only twice. With two or three exceptions, his films remain commercially unavailable and very difficult to see.\n\nHe is the son of André Hossein a Zoroastrian French composer of Azerbaijani-Tajik descent, and a Jewish comedy actress from Kiev. He was married three times: first to Marina Vlady (he has two sons with her, Pierre and Igor), later to Caroline Eliacheff (with whom he has a son, Nicholas). He is currently married to actress Candice Patou, with whom he has one son, Julien.\n\nAccording to an article written by Emannuel Peze, Hossein experienced a conversion to Catholicism in 1971 during a visit to the Marian apparition at San Damiano in Lombardo Italy.

He is widely regarded as a cultural icon. The American Film Institute ranked Bogart as the greatest male star in the history of American cinema.\n\nAfter trying various jobs, Bogart began acting in 1921 and became a regular in Broadway productions in the 1920s and 1930s. When the stock market crash of 1929 reduced the demand for plays, Bogart turned to film. His first great success was as Duke Mantee in The Petrified Forest (1936), and this led to a period of typecasting as a gangster with films such as Angels with Dirty Faces (1938) and B-movies like The Return of Doctor X (1939).\n\nHis breakthrough as a leading man came in 1941, with High Sierra and The Maltese Falcon. The next year, his performance in Casablanca raised him to the peak of his profession and, at the same time, cemented his trademark film persona, that of the hard-boiled cynic who ultimately shows his noble side.

She won three Academy Awards, two Emmy Awards, and the Tony Award for Best Actress. She is ranked as the fourth greatest female star of American cinema of all time by the American Film Institute. She is best remembered for her roles as Ilsa Lund in Casablanca (1942), a World War II drama co-starring Humphrey Bogart and as Alicia Huberman in Notorious (1946), an Alfred Hitchcock thriller co-starring Cary Grant.\n\nBefore becoming a star in American films, she had already been a leading actress in Swedish films. Her first introduction to American audiences came with her starring role in the English remake of Intermezzo in 1939. In America, she brought to the screen a \"Nordic freshness and vitality\", along with extreme beauty and intelligence, and according to the St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture, she quickly became \"the ideal of American womanhood\" and one of Hollywood's greatest leading actresses. Her producer David O. Selznick, who called her \"the most completely conscientious actress\" he had ever worked with, gave her a seven-year acting contract, thereby assuring her continual stardom.\n\nA few of her other starring roles, besides Casablanca, included For Whom the Bell Tolls (1943), Gaslight (1944), The Bells of St. Mary's (1945), Alfred Hitchcock's Spellbound (1945), Notorious (1946), and Under Capricorn (1949), and the independent production, Joan of Arc (1948). In 1950, after a decade of stardom in American films, she starred in the Italian film Stromboli, which led to a love affair with director Roberto Rossellini while they were both already married. The affair created a scandal that forced her to return to Europe until 1956, when she made a successful Hollywood comeback in Anastasia, for which she won her second Academy Award, as well as the forgiveness of her fans. Many of her personal and film documents can be seen in the Wesleyan University Cinema Archives.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Ingrid Bergman , licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia. ", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/x6LOGUWNHH3pRO8gOup68xPJL46.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>4112, :name=>"Paul Henreid", :dob=>"1908-01-10", :bio=>"Paul Henreid (January  10, 1908 – March 29, 1992) was an Austrian actor and film director, best known for his role in Casablanca.", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/1Y04k5ItlDiN1xyghhFHhhGBSOD.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>4113, :name=>"Claude Rains", :dob=>"1889-11-10", :bio=>"Claude Rains (10 November 1889 – 30 May 1967) was an English stage and film actor whose career spanned 47 years; he later held American citizenship. He was known for many roles in Hollywood  films, among them the title role in The Invisible Man (1933), a corrupt senator in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington  (1939), and, perhaps his most famous performance, Captain Renault in Casablanca (1942).\n\nRains was born William Claude Rains in Camberwell, London on November 10, 1889. He grew up, according to his daughter, with \"a very serious cockney accent and a speech impediment\".  His father was British stage actor Frederick Rains, and the young Rains made his stage debut at 11 in Nell of Old Drury.\n\nHis acting talents were recognised by Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree, founder of The Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. Tree paid for the elocution lessons Rains needed in order to succeed as an actor. Later, Rains taught at the institution, teaching John Gielgud and Laurence Olivier, among others.\n\nRains served in the First World War in the London Scottish Regiment, with fellow actors Basil Rathbone, Ronald Colman and Herbert Marshall. Rains was involved in a gas attack that left him nearly blind in one eye for the rest of his life. However, the war did aid his social advancement and, by its end, he had risen from the rank of Private to Captain.\n\nRains began his career in the London theatre, having a success in the title role of John Drinkwater's play Ulysses S. Grant, the follow-up to the playwright's major hit Abraham Lincoln, and traveled to Broadway in the late 1920s to act in leading roles in such plays as Shaw's The Apple Cart and in the dramatizations of The Constant Nymph, and Pearl S. Buck's novel The Good Earth, as a Chinese farmer.\n\nRains came relatively late to film acting and his first screen test was a failure, but his distinctive voice won him the title role in James Whale's The Invisible Man (1933) when someone accidentally overheard his screen test being played in the next room. Rains later credited director Michael Curtiz with teaching him the more understated requirements of film acting, or \"what not to do in front of a camera\".", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/l8di3lovLqcJQ8gbHKJltQk5KvD.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>3001, :name=>"Conrad Veidt", :dob=>"1893-01-22", :bio=>"Hans Walter Conrad Veidt (22 January 1893 – 3 April 1943) was a German actor best remembered for his roles in films such as Different from the Others (1919), The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920), and The Man Who Laughs (1928). After a successful career in German silent film, where he was one of the best-paid stars of Ufa, he was forced to leave Germany in 1933 with his new Jewish wife after the Nazis came to power. They settled in Britain, where he participated in a number of films, including The Thief of Bagdad (1940), before emigrating to the United States around 1941, which lead to him having a supporting role in Casablanca (1942).\n\nFrom 1916 until his death, Veidt appeared in more than 100 films. One of his earliest performances was as the murderous somnambulist Cesare in director Robert Wiene's The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920), a classic of German Expressionist cinema, with Werner Krauss and Lil Dagover. His starring role in The Man Who Laughs (1928), as a disfigured circus performer whose face is cut into a permanent grin, provided the (visual) inspiration for the Batman villain the Joker, created in 1940 by Bill Finger. Veidt also starred in other silent horror films such as The Hands of Orlac (1924), another film directed by Robert Wiene, The Student of Prague (1926) and Waxworks (1924) where he played Ivan the Terrible.\n\nVeidt also appeared in Magnus Hirschfeld's film Anders als die Andern (Different from the Others, 1919), one of the first films to sympathetically portray homosexuality, although the characters in it do not end up happily. He had a leading role in Germany's first talking picture, Das Land ohne Frauen (Land Without Women, 1929).\n\nHe moved to Hollywood in the late 1920s and made a few films, but the advent of talking pictures and his difficulty with speaking English led him to return to Germany. During this period he lent his expertise to tutoring aspiring performers, one of whom was the later American character actress Lisa Golm.", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/5PvSGqd3ZR9hjLE0Wo5yUPnKgPx.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>4114, :name=>"Sydney Greenstreet", :dob=>"1879-12-27", :bio=>"​From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nSydney Hughes Greenstreet  (27 December 1879 – 18 January 1954) was an English actor.

His father's ministering meant many moves and John was 20 when he graduated from Elgin High School in 1920. Though he was awarded a scholarship to Northwestern University after he won an oratory contest he never attended college. In a Milwaukee Journal interview he said he needed to start working and did so with the Chattaqua Circuit. Eventually reaching Broadway, he gained his big break as the Swedish janitor in Elmer Rice's Street Scene. His movie career began when he recreated the role in the film version. This was followed by his appearance in John Ford's Arrowsmith (1931) which began a more than thirty year membership in the director's \"stock company\", with important supporting roles in The Searchers (1956), Two Rode Together (1961), The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962) and Cheyenne Autumn (1964).\n\nAppearing in well over one hundred films, and acting extensively on television into the 1970s, Qualen performed many of his roles with various accents, usually Scandinavian, often intended for comic effect. Three of his more memorable roles showcase his versatility. Qualen assumed a Midwestern dialect as Muley, who recounts the destruction of his farm by the bank in Ford's The Grapes of Wrath (1940), and as the confused killer Earl Williams in Howard Hawks' classic comedy His Girl Friday (also 1940). As Berger, the jewelry-selling Norwegian resistance member in Michael Curtiz' Casablanca (1942), he essayed a light Scandinavian accent, but put on a thicker Mediterranean accent as the homeward-bound fisherman Locota in William Wellman's The High and the Mighty (1954)\n\nQualen was treasurer of The Authors Club and historian of The Masquers, Hollywood's social group for actors.\n\nJohn Qualen was blind in his later years.

He joined the road production of Al Jolson's musical Wonder Bar, before making his first film appearance, in the 1932 Trouble in Paradise. His looks and accent helped him land supporting roles in numerous movies, including Duck Soup and Nothing Sacred, and on television, well into the 1960s. It is said that he got perhaps his best-known role, Sascha in Casablanca, because he was a drinking buddy of star Humphrey Bogart.

His father was half French, half Cherokee Indian. One of five children, his father died and his mother could not raise five children alone. Along with another brother, they both admitted to the Indiana Soldiers' and Sailors' Children's Home. This did not stop him working his way through to Purdue University.\n\nWhen growing up, Blue built up his physique to become a football player (he grew to six feet three inches tall). He not only played football, but he was also a fireman, railroad worker, coal miner, cowpuncher, ranch hand, circus rider, lumberjack, and finally, a day laborer at the studios of D. W. Griffith.\n\nHe had no theatrical experience when he came to the screen. In his first movie, The Birth of a Nation (1915), he was a stuntman and an extra in the movie. In his next movie, he starred in another small part in the movie, Intolerance (1916). Gradually moving to supporting roles for both D. W. Griffith and Cecil B. DeMille, Blue earned his breakthrough role as Danton in Orphans of the Storm, starring sisters, Lillian Gish and Dorothy Gish. Then he rose to stardom as a rugged romantic lead along with top leading actresses such as Clara Bow, Gloria Swanson, and Norma Shearer. His most prolific female screen partner was Marie Prevost with whom he made several films in the mid 20s at Warner Brothers. Blue's finest silent screen performance was as the alcoholic doctor who finds paradise in MGM's White Shadows in the South Seas (1928).

She was born in Paris, and emigrated to the United States after the end of World War I.\n\nShe began acting in the 1922 Gershwin Broadway musical comedy, The French Doll, in which she had one of the main roles, \"Baroness Mazulier\". She made her film debut in the 1924 silent film, The Humming Bird, where she was one of Gloria Swanson's gang of thieves who turned into resistance fighters in World War I.\n\nWith the advent of talking pictures, and before dubbing came into general use, D'Ambricourt was used in several films which were the French version of English language ones, such as Quand on est belle (The Easiest Way — 1931), L'énigmatique Mr. Parkes (Slightly Scarlet — 1930), and Nuit d'Espagne (Transgression — 1931).\n\nShe appeared in over 70 films, including such classics as Casablanca, San Francisco, and To Have And Have Not, until about 1947, after which her film career began to decline. Her final role was in George Cukor's Les Girls, starring Gene Kelly and Mitzi Gaynor, in which she played the wardrobe woman.

His best-known performances are perhaps the German pilot in Mrs. Miniver, and the desperate refugee in Casablanca, who tries gambling to obtain travel visa money for himself and his wife. As his acting career waned, he turned to producing.\n\nDantine enrolled at the University of California, Los Angeles. His relatives thought he would go into business, but he became interested in theater. He began his U.S. acting career at the Pasadena Playhouse, while running two gas stations in order to pay his expenses. Dantine was spotted by a talent scout from Warner Bros, who signed him to a contract.\n\nDantine had uncredited parts in International Squadron and To Be or Not to Be, before his first credited role in MGM's Mrs. Miniver, playing a downed German pilot captured by the title character (played by Greer Garson). It was a huge hit, and Dantine received much positive attention from being in the film. In August 1942, Warners signed him to a new acting contract. The studio kept him busy with roles in the World War II films, The Pied Piper, Desperate Journey fighting Errol Flynn, and The Navy Comes Through. He had a sympathetic role in Casablanca, as a young refugee trying and failing to earn money via gambling. Warners begin to give Dantine more sizeable roles in their \"A\" films, Watch on the Rhine, Edge of Darkness, playing a Nazi officer, again fighting Errol Flynn, and Mission to Moscow, playing a sympathetic Russian.\n\nDantine's good looks caused him to receive a lot of fan mail and, in the words of one profile, \"the studio began to realize it had something else besides a Hollywood Hitlerite on its hands\".  Warners announced they had bought Night Action by Norman Krasna as a vehicle for Dantine, but the film appears not to have been made. Instead, he had a large role playing the villain in Northern Pursuit (1943), as a Nazi running loose in northern Canada fighting Errol Flynn again.\n\nWarner Bros. later cast him in a sympathetic role in Passage to Marseille, and he was one of several stars in Hollywood Canteen. In 1944, exhibitors voting for \"Stars of Tomorrow\", picked Dantine at number 10. Warners gave him a sympathetic lead in Hotel Berlin, as the leader of the German underground. He was once again a Nazi on-the-run in Escape in the Desert, a remake of The Petrified Forest. His last role for Warners was in the film noir, Shadow of a Woman. He then left the studio.\n\nAs his acting career wound down, he became a vice-president of Hollywood mogul Joseph Schenck's company, Schenck Enterprises, in 1959; Schenck was his wife's uncle. He later went to work as producer with Robert L. Lippert Productions and then as president of Hand Enterprises Inc.\n\nAmong Dantine's later screen appearances, there were three films for which he was the executive producer: Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia and The Killer Elite, both directed by Sam Peckinpah, and The Wilby Conspiracy. He was also in The Fifth Musketeer and Tarzan the Apeman.\n\nOn 2 May 1982, Helmut Dantine died in Beverly Hills from a heart attack at age 63. According to one obituary, \"He specialized in portrayals of Nazis, sometimes as the handsome but icy SS sadist battling Allied heroes, sometimes as a sympathetic German soldier forced, against his better judgment, to fight\".", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/tG3ACsiyxcCB1FrVDCW9B73w4fT.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>588565, :name=>"Jean De Briac", :dob=>"1891-08-15", :bio=>"", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/9XwHK5JSUtYx6HZUMITrMohtcOz.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>1331757, :name=>"George Dee", :dob=>nil, :bio=>"", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/lG5JddY8futeP7FpQhiAP6WPkX8.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>22099, :name=>"Jean Del Val", :dob=>"1891-11-17", :bio=>"", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/6IJa7xKWMh1DICJY9VphHzTsjJ3.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>1331758, :name=>"Carl Deloro", :dob=>nil, :bio=>"", :image=>"https://robohash.org/Carl Deloro?set=set3", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>1263504, :name=>"Joseph DeVillard", :dob=>nil, :bio=>"", :image=>"https://robohash.org/Joseph DeVillard?set=set3", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>1331759, :name=>"Arthur Dulac", :dob=>nil, :bio=>"", :image=>"https://robohash.org/Arthur Dulac?set=set3", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>121095, :name=>"Herbert Evans", :dob=>"1882-04-16", :bio=>"", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/tL2j1O5smA8WOdHgvrG2b1ifhdb.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>121331, :name=>"Fred Farrell", :dob=>nil, :bio=>"", :image=>"https://robohash.org/Fred Farrell?set=set3", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>121322, :name=>"Adolph Faylauer", :dob=>nil, :bio=>"", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/UsFTfNPUh2raMPRxUk9t3E7drc.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>1331760, :name=>"O.K.

He starred in hit films such as Way Down East, Orphans of the Storm, and The Cat and the Canary.\n\nWhen talkies came about, his career declined. He made several appearances in Hal Roach's Our Gang series (School's Out, Big Ears, Free Wheeling), and also played unbilled bits in major talking films such as Larceny, Inc., The Maltese Falcon, and Casablanca.\n\nHe died in the Los Angeles County city of South Pasadena and was buried at Duncans Mills Cemetery in Northern California.\n\n[TMDb FYI add-on note: While online sites differ regarding Mr. Hale's birth year, the United States Social Security Death Index indicates that he was born in 1888.

He appeared in over 90 films, starting in silent films from 1925 until his death in 1956. He is perhaps best known for his role as Juan Harker in Universal Pictures' Spanish-language version of Drácula in 1931, the English language role of Jonathan Harker originated by David Manners.  Arriving in Hollywood in the 1920s, Norton first appeared as an extra in The Black Pirate (1926) but was soon cast in Fox Films' The Lily that same year. His big break came when he was given the role of Pvt. \"Mother's Boy\" Lewisohn in What Price Glory?, which turned out to be a huge commercial success. He landed substantial roles in Legion of the Condemned and 4 Devils (both 1928), which were also very successful. His acting was well received by audiences and critics at the time, and during the silent era he avoided being typecast as a Latin lover. One theater owner in Golden City, Montana said, \"[Norton] has as yet to show me a bad performance. There's a boy that is a 'natural'.\"\n\nIn the early 1930s, Norton could still get leading roles in major films. Major Hollywood studios started producing alternate-language versions of their prestige productions, and he became one of dozens of Latino actors needed. Drácula was one of these films, but Norton also appeared in Spanish-language versions of Paramount on Parade (1930), The Benson Murder Case (1930), and The Criminal Code (1931). In a few cases, he appeared in both versions of a film. Examples include Storm Over the Andes (Spanish version: Alas sobre El Chaco), The Sea Fiend (El diablo del Mar), and Captain Calamity (El capitan Tormenta), the latter film reuniting him with Lupita Tovar, his romantic interest from Dracula.\n\nIn addition to roles in Spanish-territory films, he had roles in numerous major films, usually playing sophisticated Europeans. With the decline in Spanish-language film production in Los Angeles, Norton's opportunities for leading roles became less and less frequent. Though he had a pleasing voice, his Argentine accent seemed incongruous with his appearance. According to some sources, he never mastered English very well. In 1933, he secured what would be his last important role, playing Jean Parker's Spanish fiancé in Frank Capra's Lady for a Day (1933). Although he would continue to work for another 15 years, Norton's last credited screen role would be Should Husbands Work? (1939). For the rest of his career, Norton continued to reside in Los Angeles and obtain small roles in films. Many films he appeared in are now considered to be classics.", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/nguhCb1NDANgok4uFmv4gjw1X0c.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>94325, :name=>"Lotte Palfi Andor", :dob=>"1903-07-28", :bio=>"", :image=>"https://robohash.org/Lotte Palfi Andor?set=set3", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>89715, :name=>"Paul Panzer", :dob=>"1972-01-08", :bio=>"", :image=>"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/pZfJnLGaNLjQRdtIku3LYaI51LM.jpg", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>1331770, :name=>"Manuel París", :dob=>"1894-07-27", :bio=>"", :image=>"https://robohash.org/Manuel París?set=set3", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>1278060, :name=>"Alexander Pollard", :dob=>nil, :bio=>"", :image=>"https://robohash.org/Alexander Pollard?set=set3", :created_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11", :updated_at=>"2015-08-12 17:20:11"}, {:id=>89691, :name=>"Frank Puglia", :dob=>"1892-03-09", :bio=>"Francesco Giuseppe \"Frank\" Puglia (9 March 1892 – 25 October 1975) was an Italian-American film actor.
